IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THIS FIRMWARE

Do not use or load this firmware image (the "Firmware") until you have
carefully read the following terms and conditions. By loading or using

distribute the end-user documentation which may accompany the

If you are not the final manufacturer or vendor of a computer system

a copy of the Firmware, including any related documentation (modified
or unmodified) to your recipient for use in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, provided such recipient agrees to be fully bound by

anything to the contrary hereunder, solely with respect to the
requirements for compliance with the terms hereunder, any contractors
