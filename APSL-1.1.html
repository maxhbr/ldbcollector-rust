(a) If for any reason a court of competent\njurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,\nto be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to\nthe maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits\nand intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will\ncontinue in full force and effect.
