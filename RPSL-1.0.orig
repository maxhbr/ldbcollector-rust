When code is released as a series of files, a\nModification is: (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file\ncontaining Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of\ncomputer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code.\n\n1.10 \"Original Code\" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as\noriginally made available by Licensor under this License, including the Source\nCode of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by\nLicensor under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Licensor\nas such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled\nfrom such Source Code and originally made available by Licensor under this\nLicense.\n\n1.11 \"Personal Use\" means use of Covered Code by an individual solely for his or\nher personal, private and non-commercial purposes.

Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and\nconditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective on the date\nYou accept this License (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise\nindicating your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free,\nnon-exclusive copyright license, to the extent of Licensor's copyrights cover\nthe Original Code, to do the following:\n\n2.1 You may reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code,\nprovided that in each instance:\n\n(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright\nand other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Licensor as they appear in the\nOriginal Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to\nthis License;\n\n(b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of\nCovered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or impose\nany terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the\nrecipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6;\n\n(c) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in\nExhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause\nthe modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files\nand the date of any change;\n\n(d) You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications\npublicly available under the terms of this License, including the license grants\nset forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or\ntwelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You\nshould preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications\nelectronically (e.g. download from a web site); and\n\n(e) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must\ninclude a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related\ndocumentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under\nthe terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such\nSource Code. You must also include the Object Code Notice set forth in Exhibit A\nin the \"about\" box or other appropriate place where other copyright notices are\nplaced, including any packaging materials.\n\n2.2 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each\nContributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code\nset forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that\nthe Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property\nrights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability\nto You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\nintellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\nrights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to\nsecure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\nthird party patent license is required to allow You to make, use, sell, import\nor offer for sale the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire such\nlicense(s).\n\n2.3 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants\nYou, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using\nCovered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License), a\nworldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive patent license under\nLicensor's Applicable Patent Rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and\nimport the Covered Code, provided that in each instance you comply with the\nterms of this License.\n\n3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted\nto You under this License:\n\n(a) You grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive, perpetual,\nirrevocable, royalty free license under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other\nintellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, sell, offer\nfor sale, use, import, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and\nDeploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Licensor's licenses\nunder Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and\n\n(b) You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide,\nroyalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent\nRights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import, reproduce, display, perform,\ndistribute, modify or have modified (for Licensor and/or its subsidiaries),\nsublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form and for any purpose,\nthrough multiple tiers of distribution.\n\n(c) You agree not use any information derived from Your use and review of the\nCovered Code, including but not limited to any algorithms or inventions that may\nbe contained in the Covered Code, for the purpose of asserting any of Your\npatent rights, or assisting a third party to assert any of its patent rights,\nagainst Licensor or any Contributor.\n\n4. Derivative Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered Code\nwith other code not otherwise governed by the terms of this License and\ndistribute the Derivative Work as an integrated product. In each such instance,\nYou must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\nCovered Code or any portion thereof, including all Modifications.\n\n4.1 You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or\nExternally Deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the\nCovered Code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all\nthird parties under the terms of this License and no other license except as\nprovided in Section 4.2. You also must make Source Code available for the\nDerivative Work under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections 2\nand 3, above.\n\n4.2 Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been independently\ndeveloped without any use of Covered Code and which contain no portion of the\nCovered Code, Modifications or other Derivative Works, but are used or combined\nin any way wtih the Covered Code or any Derivative Work to form a larger\nDerivative Work, are exempt from the conditions described in Section 4.1 but\nonly to the extent that: the software module, including any software that is\nlinked to, integrated with, or part of the same applications as, the software\nmodule by any method must be wholly subject to one of the Compatible Source\nLicenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Covered Code must be subject to the\nterms of this License. Thus, the entire Derivative Work must be licensed under a\ncombination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a Compatible Source License for\nany independently developed software modules within the Derivative Work. The\nforegoing requirement applies even if the Compatible Source License would\nordinarily allow the software module to link with, or form larger works with,\nother software that is not subject to the Compatible Source License. For\nexample, although the Mozilla Public License v1.1 allows Mozilla code to be\ncombined with proprietary software that is not subject to the MPL, if\nMPL-licensed code is used with Covered Code the MPL-licensed code could not be\ncombined or linked with any code not governed by the MPL. The general intent of\nthis section 4.2 is to enable use of Covered Code with applications that are\nwholly subject to an acceptable open source license. You are responsible for\ndetermining whether your use of software with Covered Code is allowed under Your\nlicense to such software.\n\n4.3 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Covered Code with the\nCovered Code (or with a work based on the Covered Code) on a volume of a storage\nor distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense. If You deliver the Covered Code for combination and/or integration with\nan application previously provided by You (for example, via automatic updating\ntechnology), such combination and/or integration constitutes a Derivative Work\nsubject to the terms of this License.\n\n5. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to\ngrant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other\nintellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated\nherein. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor\neven if such marks are included in the Covered Code. Nothing in this License\nshall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms\nfrom this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to\nlicense. Modifications, Derivative Works and/or any use or combination of\nCovered Code with other technology provided by Licensor or third parties may\nrequire additional patent licenses from Licensor which Licensor may grant in its\nsole discretion. No patent license is granted separate from the Original Code or\ncombinations of the Original Code with other software or hardware.\n\n5.1. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or\ntrade names owned by Licensor (\"Licensor Marks\" defined in Exhibit C) or to any\ntrademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks may be\nused to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as\npermitted by the Licensor Trademark Policy defined in Exhibit C.\n\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with\nthe scope of the license granted herein (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more\nrecipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and\nas Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Licensor or any Contributor.\nYou must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are\noffered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold\nLicensor and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims\nasserted against Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional\nTerms.\n\n7. Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthis License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version\nof this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You\nmay also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent\nversion of this License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has\nthe right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this\nLicense.\n\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part\npre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain\nerrors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or\ncontain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the\nCovered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF\nANY KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS\n\"LICENSOR\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY\nDISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF\nSATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET\nENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND EACH\nCONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE\nCOVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR\nREQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR\nERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR\nWRITTEN DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR\nAUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You\nacknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in high risk\nactivities, including, but not limited to, the design, construction, operation\nor maintenance of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft\ncommunication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure\nof the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or\nenvironmental damage. Licensor disclaims any express or implied warranty of\nfitness for such uses.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT\nSHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nINDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR\nYOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER\nUNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT\nLIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR SUCH\nCONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME\nJURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event\nshall Licensor's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be\nrequired by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of ten dollars\n($10.00).\n\n10. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each\nContributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications\nmade by such Contributor. Licensor retains all rights, title and interest in and\nto the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Licensor\n(\"Licensor Modifications\"), and such Licensor Modifications will not be\nautomatically subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole discretion,\nchoose to license such Licensor Modifications under this License, or on\ndifferent terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to\nlicense them at all.\n\n11. Termination. \n\n11.1 Term and Termination. The term of this License is perpetual unless\nterminated as provided below. This License and the rights granted hereunder will\nterminate:\n\n(a) automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply with any\nterm(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming\naware of such breach;\n\n(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 12.5(b);\nor\n\n(c) automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the\nterm of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against\nLicensor (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit);\n\n(d) upon written notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term of\nthis License, commence an action for patent infringement against any third party\nalleging that the Covered Code itself (excluding combinations with other\nsoftware or hardware) infringes any patent (including by cross-claim or counter\nclaim in a lawsuit).\n\n11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any\nfurther use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the\nCovered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your\npossession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been\nproperly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this\nLicense. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the\ntermination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections\n3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for\ncompensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating\nthis License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will\nbe without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\n\n12. Miscellaneous.\n\n12.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as defined in\nFAR 2.101.

Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's\nright to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or\ndistribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as,\nor otherwise compete with, Modifications, Derivative Works, technology or\nproducts that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.\n\n12.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any\nprovision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of\nthat or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the\nlanguage of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to\nthis License.\n\n12.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds\nany provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that\nprovision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so\nas to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder\nof this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or\nspecifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability\nof either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You\nmust immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies\nof it that are in your possession or control.\n\n12.6 Dispute Resolution.
