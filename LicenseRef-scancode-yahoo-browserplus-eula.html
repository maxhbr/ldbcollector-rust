    Introduction

    Yahoo provides you with BrowserPlus, a software program which extends the functionality of your web browser, and facilitates the installation of additional software packages (plug-ins) to your web browser which various websites and services may request.

    The BrowserPlus software ("Software") consists of the following software, documentation, files and materials:

        The BrowserPlus core software application ("Core") that you receive through this installer;

        "BrowserPlus Plug-ins" or "corelets" which are any additional distinct software packages developed by Yahoo or third parties which plug into the Core, thereby extending the functionality of your web browser, AND

        Any subsequent updates, versions, or substitutes of BrowserPlus or BrowserPlus Plug-ins ("Updates") which you install.

    Yahoo licenses the Software to you subject to this agreement between you and Yahoo (the "License"). The Software may also be bundled with third party components, and may operate with plug-ins created by third party developers (collectively, "Third Party Software"). This License only applies to your use of the Software. Your use of Third Party Software is subject to the terms and conditions of the authors and owners of such Third Party Software.

    By installing and using the Software, you accept all terms and conditions of this License. Yahoo can update and change this License by posting a new version at https://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/browserplus/browserplus-2122.html without notice to you. You understand and acknowledge that your continued use of the Software, and the continued use by anyone to whom you have rightfully distributed this Software pursuant to this License, constitutes your agreement to and acceptance of all such changes and updates and that absent such effective consent, use of the Software is not authorized.

    You may use this Software to access various Yahoo services. You understand and acknowledge that your use of such Yahoo services is subject to the current version of the Yahoo Terms of Service (the "TOS"), located at https://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html, and any additional terms of service that may apply.
