If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such \nParticipant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such \nclaim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent \ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such \nParticipant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the \namount or value of any payment or license.\n\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license \nagreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by \nYou or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n9.
