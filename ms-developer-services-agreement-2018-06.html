    "Microsoft Developer Agreement\n\nLast updated: June 2018\nThis agreement is between you and Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”), and consists of the terms below (“Developer Terms”) and the Microsoft Privacy Statement (together, “Agreement”).\nIf you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, such as your employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity. If you specify a company name in connection with signing up for or ordering a Service, you will be deemed to have placed that order and to have entered into this Agreement on behalf of that organization or company. Key terms are defined in Section 10.\n1. Offerings\n    1. APIs. Your access and use of Microsoft’s APIs are governed by certain terms and conditions. As the developer, you’re responsible for your application and compliance with all the laws and regulations applicable to your use of Microsoft’s APIs, including those laws and regulations that apply to privacy, biometric data, data protection, and confidentiality of communications. Nothing in our governing agreements, or this Agreement, shall be construed as creating a joint controller or processor-sub processor relationship between you and Microsoft.\n        1. Accompanying Terms. Your use of Microsoft’s APIs is governed by the terms under which you obtained access. If you access APIs that present accompanying terms (“Accompanying Terms”), then such Accompanying Terms, along with the Microsoft Privacy Statement, will apply to your access and use of the Service. In particular, the Microsoft Graph API is provided pursuant to the terms here.\n        2. Application Registration Portal. Certain identity focused Microsoft APIs will require that you register your application here. If you are required to register your application at the following URL, then you must comply with the following terms:\n            1. Register your application. Your applications must be registered and have an App ID that is unique to each application. Once you have successfully registered an application, you will be given Access Credentials for your application. “Access Credentials” means the necessary security keys, secrets, tokens, and other credentials to access identity focused Microsoft APIs. The Access Credentials enable us to associate your application with your use of the identity focused Microsoft APIs. All activities that occur using your Access Credentials are your responsibility. Access Credentials are non-transferable and non-assignable. Keep them secret. Do not try to circumvent them. In the event of a change of control, and subject to the acquiring company’s compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the then current Graph API Terms, you may sell, assign, and transfer an application’s App ID to an acquiring company, and such acquiring company may continue to use the App ID as part of the acquired application.\n            2. Governing Terms. Unless a particular service presents Accompanying Terms to govern your access to Microsoft APIs, your application’s access to identity focused Microsoft APIs is governed by the then current Microsoft Graph API license terms, as currently available here (“Graph API Terms”).\n    2. Services.\n        1. Right to use.\u{a0}We may grant you the right to access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement.\n        2. Manner of use.

Preview features. We may make features available on a Preview basis. Previews are provided “AS-IS” and are excluded from warranties in Section 6 below. Previews may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance, privacy, availability, reliability, and support commitments, as further explained in the Privacy Statement, and any additional notices provided with the Preview. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice.

You may keep your data current by regularly refreshing the data, interfacing with a Microsoft API or Microsoft tool to maintain current data, or other processes that ensure changes to Microsoft data are accurately reflected.\n        5.

The party seeking protection must (1) give the other sole control over the defense and settlement of the claim; and (2) give reasonable help in defending the claim. The party providing the protection will (1) reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it incurs in giving that help and (2) pay the amount of any resulting adverse final judgment (or settlement that the other consents to).
