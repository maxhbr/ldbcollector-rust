7.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is "as is," we may not provide support services for it. 

8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

9.	APPLICABLE LAW.
