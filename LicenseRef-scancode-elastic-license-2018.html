PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THIS ELASTIC LICENSE AGREEMENT (THIS "AGREEMENT"), WHICH
CONSTITUTES A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT AND GOVERNS ALL OF YOUR USE OF ALL OF
THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE WITH WHICH THIS AGREEMENT IS INCLUDED ("ELASTIC SOFTWARE")
THAT IS PROVIDED IN OBJECT CODE FORMAT, AND, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 2 BELOW,
CERTAIN OF THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE THAT IS PROVIDED IN SOURCE CODE FORMAT. BY
INSTALLING OR USING ANY OF THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT, YOU
ARE ASSENTING TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
WITH SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL OR USE THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE
GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE ON
BEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE ACTUAL
AUTHORITY TO AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF
SUCH ENTITY.

Posted Date: April 20, 2018

This Agreement is entered into by and between Elasticsearch BV ("Elastic") and
You, or the legal entity on behalf of whom You are acting (as applicable,
"You").

1. OBJECT CODE END USER LICENSES, RESTRICTIONS AND THIRD PARTY OPEN SOURCE
SOFTWARE

  1.1 Object Code End User License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  Section 1.2 of this Agreement, Elastic hereby grants to You, AT NO CHARGE and
  for so long as you are not in breach of any provision of this Agreement, a
  License to the Basic Features and Functions of the Elastic Software.

  1.2 Reservation of Rights; Restrictions. As between Elastic and You, Elastic
  and its licensors own all right, title and interest in and to the Elastic
  Software, and except as expressly set forth in Sections 1.1, and 2.1 of this
  Agreement, no other license to the Elastic Software is granted to You under
  this Agreement, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. You agree not to: (i)
  reverse engineer or decompile, decrypt, disassemble or otherwise reduce any
  Elastic Software provided to You in Object Code, or any portion thereof, to
  Source Code, except and only to the extent any such restriction is prohibited
  by applicable law, (ii) except as expressly permitted in this Agreement,
  prepare derivative works from, modify, copy or use the Elastic Software Object
  Code or the Commercial Software Source Code in any manner; (iii) except as
  expressly permitted in Section 1.1 above, transfer, sell, rent, lease,
  distribute, sublicense, loan or otherwise transfer, Elastic Software Object
  Code, in whole or in part, to any third party; (iv) use Elastic Software
  Object Code for providing time-sharing services, any software-as-a-service,
  service bureau services or as part of an application services provider or
  other service offering (collectively, "SaaS Offering") where obtaining access
  to the Elastic Software or the features and functions of the Elastic Software
  is a primary reason or substantial motivation for users of the SaaS Offering
  to access and/or use the SaaS Offering ("Prohibited SaaS Offering"); (v)
  circumvent the limitations on use of Elastic Software provided to You in
  Object Code format that are imposed or preserved by any License Key, or (vi)
  alter or remove any Marks and Notices in the Elastic Software. If You have any
  question as to whether a specific SaaS Offering constitutes a Prohibited SaaS
  Offering, or are interested in obtaining Elastic's permission to engage in
  commercial or non-commercial distribution of the Elastic Software, please
  contact elastic_license@elastic.co.

  1.3 Third Party Open Source Software. The Commercial Software may contain or
  be provided with third party open source libraries, components, utilities and
  other open source software (collectively, "Open Source Software"), which Open
  Source Software may have applicable license terms as identified on a website
  designated by Elastic. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, use of
  the Open Source Software shall be subject to the license terms and conditions
  applicable to such Open Source Software, to the extent required by the
  applicable licensor (which terms shall not restrict the license rights granted
  to You hereunder, but may contain additional rights). To the extent any
  condition of this Agreement conflicts with any license to the Open Source
  Software, the Open Source Software license will govern with respect to such
  Open Source Software only. Elastic may also separately provide you with
  certain open source software that is licensed by Elastic. Your use of such
  Elastic open source software will not be governed by this Agreement, but by
  the applicable open source license terms.

2. COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE SOURCE CODE

  2.1 Limited License. Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.2 of
  this Agreement, Elastic hereby grants to You, AT NO CHARGE and for so long as
  you are not in breach of any provision of this Agreement, a limited,
  non-exclusive, non-transferable, fully paid up royalty free right and license
  to the Commercial Software in Source Code format, without the right to grant
  or authorize sublicenses, to prepare Derivative Works of the Commercial
  Software, provided You (i) do not hack the licensing mechanism, or otherwise
  circumvent the intended limitations on the use of Elastic Software to enable
  features other than Basic Features and Functions or those features You are
  entitled to as part of a Subscription, and (ii) use the resulting object code
  only for reasonable testing purposes.

  2.2 Restrictions. Nothing in Section 2.1 grants You the right to (i) use the
  Commercial Software Source Code other than in accordance with Section 2.1
  above, (ii) use a Derivative Work of the Commercial Software outside of a
  Non-production Environment, in any production capacity, on a temporary or
  permanent basis, or (iii) transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, sublicense,
  loan or otherwise make available the Commercial Software Source Code, in whole
  or in part, to any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may
  maintain a copy of the repository in which the Source Code of the Commercial
  Software resides and that copy may be publicly accessible, provided that you
  include this Agreement with Your copy of the repository.

3. TERMINATION

  3.1 Termination. This Agreement will automatically terminate, whether or not
  You receive notice of such Termination from Elastic, if You breach any of its
  provisions.

  3.2 Post Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, for any reason,
  You shall promptly cease the use of the Elastic Software in Object Code format
  and cease use of the Commercial Software in Source Code format. For the
  avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement will not affect Your right
  to use Elastic Software, in either Object Code or Source Code formats, made
  available under the Apache License Version 2.0.

  3.3 Survival. Sections 1.2, 2.2. 3.3, 4 and 5 shall survive any termination or
  expiration of this Agreement.

4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

  4.1 Disclaimer of Warranties. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE
  LAW, THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
  AND ELASTIC AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR
  STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
  PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ELASTIC AND ITS LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY
  DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE, AND WITH
  RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE FOREGOING. FURTHER, ELASTIC DOES NOT WARRANT RESULTS
  OF USE OR THAT THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR THAT THE USE OF THE
  ELASTIC SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED.

  4.2 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL ELASTIC OR ITS LICENSORS BE
  LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES,
  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS
  INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY
  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, IN CONNECTION WITH
  OR ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE, OR THE
  PERFORMANCE OF OR FAILURE TO PERFORM THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A
  BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF ELASTIC
  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

5. MISCELLANEOUS

  This Agreement completely and exclusively states the entire agreement of the
  parties regarding the subject matter herein, and it supersedes, and its terms
  govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the
  parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. This Agreement may be
  modified by Elastic from time to time, and any such modifications will be
  effective upon the "Posted Date" set forth at the top of the modified
  Agreement. If any provision hereof is held unenforceable, this Agreement will
  continue without said provision and be interpreted to reflect the original
  intent of the parties. This Agreement and any non-contractual obligation
  arising out of or in connection with it, is governed exclusively by Dutch law.
  This Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 UN Convention on Contracts
  for the International Sale of Goods. All disputes arising out of or in
  connection with this Agreement, including its existence and validity, shall be
  resolved by the courts with jurisdiction in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, except
  where mandatory law provides for the courts at another location in The
  Netherlands to have jurisdiction. The parties hereby irrevocably waive any and
  all claims and defenses either might otherwise have in any such action or
  proceeding in any of such courts based upon any alleged lack of personal
  jurisdiction, improper venue, forum non conveniens or any similar claim or
  defense. A breach or threatened breach, by You of Section 2 may cause
  irreparable harm for which damages at law may not provide adequate relief, and
  therefore Elastic shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief without being
  required to post a bond. You may not assign this Agreement (including by
  operation of law in connection with a merger or acquisition), in whole or in
  part to any third party without the prior written consent of Elastic, which
  may be withheld or granted by Elastic in its sole and absolute discretion.
  Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is void. Notices to
  Elastic may also be sent to legal@elastic.co.
