You\n  expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Original Code, or\n  any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.  THE ORIGINAL\n  CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT\n  OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (FOR THE PURPOSES OF\n  SECTIONS 8 AND 9, APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) ARE COLLECTIVELY\n  REFERRED TO AS \"APPLE\") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR\n  CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR\n  SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\n  NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT\n  THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL MEET YOUR\n  REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE\n  UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE ORIGINAL CODE\n  WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN\n  BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A\n  WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY.

In no event shall Apple's total\n  liability to You for all damages under this License exceed the\n  amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\n\n10. Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the\n   trademarks or trade names \"Apple\", \"Apple Computer\", \"Mac OS X\",\n   \"Mac OS X Server\" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging\n   to Apple (collectively \"Apple Marks\") and no Apple Marks may be\n   used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code\n   other than as permitted by and in strict compliance at all times\n   with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are\n   posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.\n\n11. Ownership.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to\n   the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of\n   Apple (\"Apple Modifications\"), and such Apple Modifications will\n   not be automatically subject to this License.  Apple may, at its\n   sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under\n   this License, or on different terms from those contained in this\n   License or may choose not to license them at all.  Apple's\n   development, use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and\n   distribution of Covered Code will not be subject to this License.\n\n12. Termination.\n\n12.1 Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n   terminate:\n\n(a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with\nany term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30\ndays of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of\nthe circumstances described in Sections 9.1 and/or 13.6(b); or (c)\nautomatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the\nterm of this License, commence an action for patent infringement\nagainst Apple.\n\n12.2 Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to\n   immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification and\n   distribution of the Covered Code, or Affected Original Code in the\n   case of termination under Section 9.1, and to destroy all copies of\n   the Covered Code or Affected Original Code (in the case of\n   termination under Section 9.1) that are in your possession or\n   control.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been\n   properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination\n   of this License.  Provisions which, by their nature, should remain\n   in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive,\n   including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and\n   13.  Neither party will be liable to the other for compensation,\n   indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating\n   this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this\n   License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of\n   either party.\n\n13.  Miscellaneous.\n\n13.1 Export Law Assurances.  You may not use or otherwise export or\n   re-export the Original Code except as authorized by United States\n   law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Original Code was\n   obtained.  In particular, but without limitation, the Original Code\n   may not be exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or\n   resident of) any U.S. embargoed country or (b) to anyone on the\n   U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals\n   or the U.S. Department of Commerce's Table of Denial Orders.  By\n   using the Original Code, You represent and warrant that You are not\n   located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any such\n   country or on any such list.\n\n13.2 Government End Users.  The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as\n   defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data\n   rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily\n   provided to the public as defined in this License.

Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire\n   Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n13.3 Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as\n   creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of\n   legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent\n   to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or\n   otherwise.\n\n13.4 Independent Development.  Nothing in this License will impair\n   Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for\n   it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform\n   the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,\n   Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may\n   develop, produce, market or distribute.\n\n13.5 Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple to enforce any provision\n   of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement\n   of that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which\n   provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against\n   the drafter will not apply to this License.\n\n13.6 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent\n   jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion\n   thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be\n   enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the\n   economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of\n   this License will continue in full force and effect.  (b)\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or\n   restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with\n   Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of\n   those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You\n   must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and\n   destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\n\n13.7 Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution\n   between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in\n   the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby\n   consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state\n   and federal courts within that District with respect to this\n   License. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\n   excluded.\n\n13.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the\n   entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject\n   matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the\n   United States and the State of California, except that body of\n   California law concerning conflicts of law.\n\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following\nclause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested\nthat this License and all related documents be drafted in English.
