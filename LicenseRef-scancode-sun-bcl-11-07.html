5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT
PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT
OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,

SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will
Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort

amount paid by you for Software under this
Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply

Agreement will be governed by California law and
controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law
rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision
omitted, unless omission would frustrate the
intent of the parties, in which case this
Agreement will immediately terminate.

11. Integration. This Agreement is the entire
agreement between you and Sun relating to its
subject matter. It supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous oral or written communications,
proposals, representations and warranties and
prevails over any conflicting or additional terms
of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other
