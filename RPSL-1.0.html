(Rev. Date October 28, 2002)

1. General Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which
RealNetworks, Inc., or any other entity that elects to use this license,
("Licensor") makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by
Licensor identifying such program or work as "Original Code" and stating that it
is subject to the terms of this RealNetworks Public Source License version 1.0
(or subsequent version thereof) ("License"). You are not required to accept this
License. However, nothing else grants You permission to use, copy, modify or
distribute the software or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by
law if You do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying, copying or
distributing the software (or any work based on the software), You indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions. In
addition, you agree to the terms of this License by clicking the Accept button
or downloading the software. As used in this License:

1.1 "Applicable Patent Rights" mean: (a) in the case where Licensor is the
grantor of rights, claims of patents that (i) are now or hereafter acquired,
owned by or assigned to Licensor and (ii) are necessarily infringed by using or
making the Original Code alone and not in combination with other software or
hardware; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights, claims of
patents that (i) are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and
(ii) are infringed (directly or indirectly) by using or making Your
Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.

1.2 "Compatible Source License" means any one of the licenses listed on Exhibit
B or at https://www.helixcommunity.org/content/complicense or other licenses
specifically identified by Licensor in writing. Notwithstanding any term to the
contrary in any Compatible Source License, any code covered by any Compatible
Source License that is used with Covered Code must be made readily available in
Source Code format for royalty-free use under the terms of the Compatible Source
License or this License.

1.3 "Contributor" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to the
creation of Modifications.

1.4 "Covered Code" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of
Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.

1.5 "Deploy" means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other than for
Your internal research and development (R&D) and/or Personal Use, and includes
without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of Covered Code
within Your business or organization except for R&D use and/or Personal Use, as
well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Covered Code by You
to any third party in any form or manner.

1.6 "Derivative Work" means either the Covered Code or any derivative work under
United States copyright law, and including any work containing or including any
portion of the Covered Code or Modifications, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. Derivative Work also
includes any work which combines any portion of Covered Code or Modifications
with code not otherwise governed by the terms of this License.

1.7 "Externally Deploy" means to Deploy the Covered Code in any way that may be
accessed or used by anyone other than You, used to provide any services to
anyone other than You, or used in any way to deliver any content to anyone other
than You, whether the Covered Code is distributed to those parties, made
available as an application intended for use over a computer network, or used to
provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than You.

1.8. "Interface" means interfaces, functions, properties, class definitions,
APIs, header files, GUIDs, V-Tables, and/or protocols allowing one piece of
software, firmware or hardware to communicate or interoperate with another piece
of software, firmware or hardware.

1.9 "Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the
substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the
combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any
respective portions thereof. When code is released as a series of files, a
Modification is: (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
containing Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of
computer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code.

1.10 "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as
originally made available by Licensor under this License, including the Source
Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by
Licensor under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Licensor
as such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled
from such Source Code and originally made available by Licensor under this
License.

1.11 "Personal Use" means use of Covered Code by an individual solely for his or
her personal, private and non-commercial purposes. An individual's use of
Covered Code in his or her capacity as an officer, employee, member, independent
contractor or agent of a corporation, business or organization (commercial or
non-commercial) does not qualify as Personal Use.

1.12 "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other work that
is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains,
plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control
compilation and installation of an executable (object code).

1.13 "You" or "Your" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under this License. For legal entities, "You" or "Your" includes any entity
which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, You, where
"control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of
fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of
such entity.

2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective on the date
You accept this License (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise
indicating your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive copyright license, to the extent of Licensor's copyrights cover
the Original Code, to do the following:

2.1 You may reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code,
provided that in each instance:

(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright
and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Licensor as they appear in the
Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to
this License;

(b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of
Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or impose
any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the
recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6;

(c) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in
Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause
the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files
and the date of any change;

(d) You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications
publicly available under the terms of this License, including the license grants
set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or
twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You
should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications
electronically (e.g. download from a web site); and

(e) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must
include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related
documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under
the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such
Source Code. You must also include the Object Code Notice set forth in Exhibit A
in the "about" box or other appropriate place where other copyright notices are
placed, including any packaging materials.

2.2 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each
Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code
set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that
the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability
to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
third party patent license is required to allow You to make, use, sell, import
or offer for sale the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire such
license(s).

2.3 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants
You, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using
Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License), a
worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive patent license under
Licensor's Applicable Patent Rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and
import the Covered Code, provided that in each instance you comply with the
terms of this License.

3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted
to You under this License:

(a) You grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable, royalty free license under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other
intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, sell, offer
for sale, use, import, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and
Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Licensor's licenses
under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and

(b) You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent
Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, reproduce, display, perform,
distribute, modify or have modified (for Licensor and/or its subsidiaries),
sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form and for any purpose,
through multiple tiers of distribution.

(c) You agree not use any information derived from Your use and review of the
Covered Code, including but not limited to any algorithms or inventions that may
be contained in the Covered Code, for the purpose of asserting any of Your
patent rights, or assisting a third party to assert any of its patent rights,
against Licensor or any Contributor.

4. Derivative Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered Code
with other code not otherwise governed by the terms of this License and
distribute the Derivative Work as an integrated product. In each such instance,
You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
Covered Code or any portion thereof, including all Modifications.

4.1 You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or
Externally Deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Covered Code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License and no other license except as
provided in Section 4.2. You also must make Source Code available for the
Derivative Work under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections 2
and 3, above.

4.2 Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been independently
developed without any use of Covered Code and which contain no portion of the
Covered Code, Modifications or other Derivative Works, but are used or combined
in any way wtih the Covered Code or any Derivative Work to form a larger
Derivative Work, are exempt from the conditions described in Section 4.1 but
only to the extent that: the software module, including any software that is
linked to, integrated with, or part of the same applications as, the software
module by any method must be wholly subject to one of the Compatible Source
Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Covered Code must be subject to the
terms of this License. Thus, the entire Derivative Work must be licensed under a
combination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a Compatible Source License for
any independently developed software modules within the Derivative Work. The
foregoing requirement applies even if the Compatible Source License would
ordinarily allow the software module to link with, or form larger works with,
other software that is not subject to the Compatible Source License. For
example, although the Mozilla Public License v1.1 allows Mozilla code to be
combined with proprietary software that is not subject to the MPL, if
MPL-licensed code is used with Covered Code the MPL-licensed code could not be
combined or linked with any code not governed by the MPL. The general intent of
this section 4.2 is to enable use of Covered Code with applications that are
wholly subject to an acceptable open source license. You are responsible for
determining whether your use of software with Covered Code is allowed under Your
license to such software.

4.3 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Covered Code with the
Covered Code (or with a work based on the Covered Code) on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License. If You deliver the Covered Code for combination and/or integration with
an application previously provided by You (for example, via automatic updating
technology), such combination and/or integration constitutes a Derivative Work
subject to the terms of this License.

5. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated
herein. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor
even if such marks are included in the Covered Code. Nothing in this License
shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms
from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
license. Modifications, Derivative Works and/or any use or combination of
Covered Code with other technology provided by Licensor or third parties may
require additional patent licenses from Licensor which Licensor may grant in its
sole discretion. No patent license is granted separate from the Original Code or
combinations of the Original Code with other software or hardware.

5.1. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or
trade names owned by Licensor ("Licensor Marks" defined in Exhibit C) or to any
trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks may be
used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as
permitted by the Licensor Trademark Policy defined in Exhibit C.

6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with
the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more
recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and
as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Licensor or any Contributor.
You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold
Licensor and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims
asserted against Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional
Terms.

7. Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of
this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version
of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You
may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent
version of this License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has
the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
License.

8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part
pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain
errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or
contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the
Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF
ANY KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS
"LICENSOR" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF
SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET
ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND EACH
CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE
COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR
REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR
WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You
acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in high risk
activities, including, but not limited to, the design, construction, operation
or maintenance of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft
communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure
of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
environmental damage. Licensor disclaims any express or implied warranty of
fitness for such uses.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR
YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER
UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT
LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR SUCH
CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event
shall Licensor's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be
required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of ten dollars
($10.00).

10. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each
Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications
made by such Contributor. Licensor retains all rights, title and interest in and
to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Licensor
("Licensor Modifications"), and such Licensor Modifications will not be
automatically subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole discretion,
choose to license such Licensor Modifications under this License, or on
different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to
license them at all.

11. Termination. 

11.1 Term and Termination. The term of this License is perpetual unless
terminated as provided below. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate:

(a) automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply with any
term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming
aware of such breach;

(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 12.5(b);
or

(c) automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the
term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against
Licensor (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit);

(d) upon written notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term of
this License, commence an action for patent infringement against any third party
alleging that the Covered Code itself (excluding combinations with other
software or hardware) infringes any patent (including by cross-claim or counter
claim in a lawsuit).

11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any
further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the
Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your
possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been
properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this
License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections
3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for
compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating
this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will
be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.

12. Miscellaneous.

12.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined in
FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code
include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this
License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is
provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer
Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical
Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software
or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users
acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

12.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an
agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
between or among You, Licensor or any Contributor, and You will not represent to
the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.

12.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's
right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as,
or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Derivative Works, technology or
products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.

12.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any
provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of
that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to
this License.

12.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds
any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that
provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so
as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder
of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or
specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability
of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You
must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies
of it that are in your possession or control.

12.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You
and Licensor relating to this License shall take place in the Seattle,
Washington, and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of,
and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to
this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

12.7 Export/Import Laws. This software is subject to all export and import laws
and restrictions and regulations of the country in which you receive the Covered
Code and You are solely responsible for ensuring that You do not export,
re-export or import the Covered Code or any direct product thereof in violation
of any such restrictions, laws or regulations, or without all necessary
authorizations.

12.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of
