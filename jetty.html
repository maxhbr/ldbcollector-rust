$Revision: 584 $

Preamble:
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which the Jetty
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance
of control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use, distribute and make reasonable modifications to the
Package in accordance with the goals and ideals of the Open Source concept as
described at http://www.opensource.org.

It is the intent of this license to allow commercial usage of the Jetty package,
so long as the source code is distributed or suitable visible credit given or
other arrangements made with the copyright holders.

Definitions:
* "Jetty" refers to the collection of Java classes that are distributed as a
HTTP server with servlet capabilities and associated utilities.

* "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification.

* "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

* "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for
the package.  Mort Bay Consulting Pty. Ltd. (Australia) is the "Copyright Holder" for
the Jetty package.

* "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
Package.

* "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

* "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that
recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
received it.

0. The Jetty Package is Copyright (c) Mort Bay Consulting Pty. Ltd. (Australia)
and others. Individual files in this package may contain additional copyright
notices. The javax.servlet packages are copyright Sun Microsystems Inc.

1. The Standard Version of the Jetty package is available from
http://jetty.mortbay.org.

2. You may make and distribute verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you include
this license and all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

3. You may make and distribute verbatim copies of the compiled form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you include
this license.

4. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such
a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

5. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) Place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as
ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in
the Standard Version of the Package.

b) Use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

c) Rename any non-standard classes so the names do not conflict with
standard classes, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual
page for each non-standard class that clearly documents how it differs from the
Standard Version.

d) Make other arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

6. You may distribute modifications or subsets of this Package in source code or
compiled form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) Distribute this license and all original copyright messages, together
with instructions (in the about dialog, manual page or equivalent) on where to
get the complete Standard Version.

b) Accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
Package with your modifications. The modified package must include this license
and all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers, together
with instructions on where to get the complete Standard Version.

c) Make other arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

7. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not
charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package
in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger
(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you meet the other
distribution requirements of this license.

8. Input to or the output produced from the programs of this Package do not
automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever
generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.

9. Any program subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall
not be considered part of this Package.

10. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

11. This license may change with each release of a Standard Version of the
Package. You may choose to use the license associated with version you are using
or the license of the latest Standard Version.

12. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

13. If any superior law implies a warranty, the sole remedy under such shall be, 
at the Copyright Holders option either 
a) return of any price paid or 
b) use or reasonable endeavours to repair or replace the software.

14. This license shall be read under the laws of Australia.
