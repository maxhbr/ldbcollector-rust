If the Services shall be the subject of an infringement claim, or AppsFlyer reasonably believes that the Services shall be the subject of an infringement claim, AppsFlyer may terminate this Agreement with written notice if modification of the Services to be non-infringing is not reasonably practical.\n\n12.2. Company Indemnification. Company shall defend and indemnify AppsFlyer (and its affiliates, officers, directors and employees) from and against any and all damages, costs, losses, liabilities or expenses (including court costs and attorneys’ fees) which AppsFlyer may suffer or incur in connection with any actual claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any third party arising from: (a) any breach of Company’s obligations, representations or warranties herein; or (b) any use or distribution of the Company’s Application in violation of this Agreement or applicable law or regulations.\n\n12.3. Procedure. The obligations of either party to provide indemnification under this Agreement will be contingent upon the indemnified party (i) providing the indemnifying party with prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that the indemnified party’s failure to notify the indemnifying party will not diminish the indemnifying party’s obligations under this Section 12 except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure), (ii) cooperating fully with the indemnifying party (at the indemnifying party’s expense), and (iii) allowing the indemnifying party to control the defense and settlement of such claim, provided that no settlement may be entered into without the consent of the indemnified party if such settlement would require any action on the part of the indemnified party other than to cease using any allegedly infringing or illegal content or services. Subject to the foregoing, an indemnified party will at all times have the option to participate in any matter or litigation through counsel of its own selection at its own expense.\n\n13.

WITH RESPECT TO THE CARVE-OUT CLAIMS, APPSFLYER’S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR THE PROVISION OF THE SERVICES OR UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED TWO (2) TIMES THE AMOUNT OF PAYMENT RECEIVED BY APPSFLYER FROM COMPANY IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE CLAIM, IN THE AGGREGATE.\n\n15. Term and Termination.\n\n15.1. The term of this Agreement shall commence as of the day you accept this Agreement or, if earlier, the date that you integrate the Code into an Application and shall continue in effect for a period of twelve (12) months (the “Initial Term”); provided that if Company selects the “Basic Pay-Per-Use” package, as shown on AppsFlyer’s website, this Agreement shall be in effect on a month-to-month basis. Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for subsequent terms of twelve (12) months each (each a “Renewal Term” and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”), unless one of the parties notifies the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement at least 45 days prior to the commencement of any Renewal Term.\n\n15.2. Either party may terminate this Agreement with written notice if it has reason to believe that the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement, and such breach is not cured within 30 days from the receipt of written notice of such breach.

Any obligations of the Parties that by their nature are intended to survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement, including the obligations of the Parties in Sections 3 – 9 and 12 – 15 of this Agreement, shall survive any termination thereof.\n\n16. Publicity. During the Term, AppsFlyer may refer to Company as a customer of AppsFlyer, including by displaying Company’s name and logo on AppsFlyer’s website and other marketing materials.\n\n17. Miscellaneous.\n\n17.1. This Agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all other agreements between the parties, whether written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof.

Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement may not be modified or amended except in a writing executed by both parties.\n\n17.2. All waivers must be in writing. A waiver of any default hereunder or of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a continuing waiver or a waiver of any other default or of any other term or condition, but shall apply solely to the instance to which such waiver is directed. AppsFlyer may provide Company with notices required hereunder by contacting Company at any email address Company provided, including in its registration information.\n\n17.3. Neither Party may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, such consent not to be required in the event of an assignment by one of the Parties to a purchaser of all or substantially all of the assignor’s assets or share capital. The assignor shall provide the other Party with written notice of the assignment. Assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be void.\n\n17.4. If any part of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, such part shall be interpreted to give the maximum force possible to such terms as possible under applicable law, and such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other part or provision of this Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect.\n17.5. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, and the competent courts in the city of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear any disputes arising hereunder.\n\nAppendix A: Fees and Services\n\n[PACKAGE OF SERVICES TO BE CHOSEN BY COMPANY]\n\nAppendix B: Service Levels\n\nAppsFlyer service commitments do not include downtime to extent resulting from: previously scheduled maintenance and events beyond AppsFlyer’s reasonable control, such as any down time (a) caused by outages to any public Internet backbones, networks or servers, (b) caused by any failures of Company’s Application, equipment, systems or local access services, or (c) strikes, riots, insurrection, fires, floods, explosions, war, governmental action, labor conditions, earthquakes or natural disasters.",
