    "            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE OF \"ICOT FREE SOFTWARE\"\n\n\nThe follwing Terms and Conditions for use of \"ICOT FREE SOFTWARE\"\n\nis applied to all of:\n\n  * ICOT Free Software that ICOT releases\n  * Revised ICOT Free Software after its release\n  * Revised ICOT Free Software after its release\n\n\n1. Purposes and Background of ICOT Free Software.\n\n    The Institute for New Generation Computer Technology (\"ICOT\")\nhad been promoting the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project under\nthe commitment of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry of\nJapan (the \"MITI\").  Since April 1993, ICOT has been promoting the\nFollow-on project to the FGCS project. This follow-on project aims to\ndisseminate and further develop FGCS technology. The FGCS project and\nthe Follow-on project (collectively, the \"Project\") have been aimed at\ncreating basic technology for novel computers that realizes parallel\ninference processing as their core mechanism, and contributing toward\nthe progress of computer science by sharing innovative knowledge and\ntechnology with the research community worldwide.\n\n    Innovative hardware and software parallel inference technology\nhas been under development through the Project, which involves\nvarieties of advanced software for experiments and evaluation. This\nsoftware, being at a basic stage of research and development, should\nbe disseminated widely to the research community.\n\n    According to the aims of the Project, ICOT has made this\nsoftware, the copyright of which does not belong to the government but\nto ICOT itself, available to the public in order to contribute to the\nworld, and, moreover, has removed all restrictions on its usage that\nmay have impeded further research and development in order that large\nnumbers of researchers can use it freely to begin a new era of\ncomputer science.\n\n    This program together with any attached documentation (collec-\ntively, the \"Program\") is being distributed by ICOT free of charge as\nICOT Free Software.\n\n\n2. Free Use, Modification, Copying and Distribution\n\n    Persons wanting to use the Program (\"Users\") may freely do so\nand may also freely modify and copy the Program. The term \"modify,\" as\nused here, includes, but is not limited to, any act to improve or\nexpand the Program for the purposes of enhancing and/or improving its\nfunction, performance and/or quality as well as to add one or more\nprograms or documents developed by Users of the Program.\n\n    Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in\nits original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED\nthat the provisions of Section 3 (\"NO WARRANTY\") will ALWAYS appear\non, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially\nin the same form as set out herein and that such intended\ndistribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise\ncontravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having\njurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.\n\n\n3. NO WARRANTY\n\n    The program was produced on an experimental basis in the\ncourse of the research and development conducted during the project\nand is provided to users as so produced on an experimental basis. \nAccordingly, the program is provided without any warranty whatsoever,\nwhether express, implied, statutory or otherwise. The term \"warranty\"\nused herein includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the\nquality, performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular\npurpose of the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or\nviolation of any right of any third party.\n\n    Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be\ndeemed to have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty\nwhatsoever for the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising\nfrom or otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.\n\n    Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other\norganization that participated in or was otherwise related to the\ndevelopment of the program and their respective officials, directors,\nofficers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all\ndamages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental\nand consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection\nwith the use or inability to use the program or any product, material\nor result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,\nregardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had\nknowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the\nproject or thereafter. Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the\nforegoing by his or her commencement of use of the program. The term\n\"use\" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,\nmodification, copying and distribution of the program and the\nproduction of secondary products from the program.\n\n    In the case where the program, whether in its original form or\nmodified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from\nany person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or\ngrants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in\nwriting, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted\nfrom and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted\nabove as far as the program is concerned.",
