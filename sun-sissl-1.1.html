You may not offer or\n   impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts\n   the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights\n   hereunder. Your license for shipment of the Contributor Version is\n   conditioned upon Your full compliance with this Section. The\n   Modifications which You create must comply with all requirements set\n   out by the Standards body in effect one hundred twenty (120) days\n   before You ship the Contributor Version. In the event that the\n   Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to publish\n   either (i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from\n   implementation of Your Modifications and a reference implementation of\n   Your Modifications or (ii) Your Modifications in Source Code form, and\n   to make any such deviation and reference implementation or\n   Modifications available to all third parties under the same terms as\n   this license on a royalty free basis within thirty (30) days of Your\n   first customer shipment of Your Modifications.\n\n   3.2 Required Notices.\n   You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n   Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n   Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n   location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n   to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)\n   You may add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n   Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n   for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\n   rights relating to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to\n   charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n   obligations to one or more recipients of Your version of the Code.\n   However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of\n   the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such\n   warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You\n   alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any\n   liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of warranty,\n   support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n   3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions.\n   You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source form only if\n   the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that\n   Original Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source\n   Code version of the Original Code is available under the terms of this\n   License. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an\n   Executable or Source versions, related documentation or collateral in\n   which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Original Code.\n   You may distribute the Executable and Source versions of Your version\n   of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which\n   may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are\n   in compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the\n   Executable and Source versions under a different license You must make\n   it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are\n   offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby agree\n   to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the\n   Initial Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n   3.4 Larger Works.\n   You may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with other\n   code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n   Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure\n   the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code.\n\n   4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n   License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to\n   statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n   the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n   describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n   must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must\n   be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n   understand it.\n\n   5.0 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE\n\n   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n   attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Modifications as set\n   out in Section 3.1.\n\n   6.0 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE\n\n   6.1 New Versions.\n   Sun may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time\n   to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n   6.2 Effect of New Versions.\n   Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of\n   the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n   version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms\n   of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one\n   other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n   Original Code.\n\n   7.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\n\n   ORIGINAL CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n   WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL CODE IS FREE OF\n   DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n   THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE ORIGINAL CODE\n   IS WITH YOU.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\n   CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY ORIGINAL\n   CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n   8.0 TERMINATION\n\n   8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n   automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n   such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n   sublicenses to the Original Code which are properly granted shall\n   survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n   nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n   shall survive.\n\n   8.2 In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all end user\n   license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have\n   been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to\n   termination shall survive termination.\n\n   9.0 LIMIT OF LIABILITY\n\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n   DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF ORIGINAL CODE,\n   OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n   ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n   CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n   WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n   COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n   INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
