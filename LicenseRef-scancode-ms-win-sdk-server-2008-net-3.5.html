MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft 
􏰀  updates,
􏰀  supplements,

b. Included Microsoft Programs. The software contains other Microsoft programs. These license terms apply to your use of those programs.

2. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS. 

a. Distributable Code. The software contains code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the terms below. 
i. Right to Use and Distribute. 
The code and text files listed below are "Distributable Code."

􏰀 Microsoft Merge Modules. You may copy and distribute the unmodified output of Microsoft Merge Modules. 
􏰀 Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.
ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, 
you must
􏰀 add significant primary functionality to it in your programs; 
􏰀 for any Distributable Code having a filename extension of .lib, distribute only the results of running such Distributable Code through a linker with your application; 
􏰀 distribute Distributable Code included in a setup program only as part of that setup program without modification; 
􏰀 require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement; 
􏰀 display your valid copyright notice on your programs;

􏰀 include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or 
􏰀 modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that 
􏰀 the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or 
􏰀 others have the right to modify it. 

b. Additional Functionality. Microsoft may provide additional functionality for the software. Other license terms and fees may apply.

3. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.

6. CODE GENERATION AND OPTIMIZATION TOOLS. You may not use the code generation or optimization tools in the software (such as compilers, linkers, assemblers, runtime code generators, and 
code generating design and modeling tools) to create programs, object code, libraries, assemblies, or executables to run on a platform other than Microsoft operating systems, run-time technologies, or application platforms.

7. BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it only to reinstall the software.

12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

13. APPLICABLE LAW.
a. United States.

14. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country.

This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

15. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE.

This limitation applies to 
􏰀 anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and 
􏰀 claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
