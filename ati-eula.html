   the ATI Hardware and the related documentation  and  provided  the  other
   party reads and agrees  to  accept  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this
   License.  Upon such transfer your license rights are then terminated.

(d)   In addition to the license terms above, with respect  to  portions  of
the Software in source code or binary  form  designed  exclusively  for  use
with the Linux operating system ("ATI Linux Code"), you  may  use,  display,

   vi) to  the  extent  there  is  any ATI sample or  control  panel  source

   license terms that grant such rights; and

   vii) ATI is not obligated to provide any maintenance or technical support
   for any code resulting from ATI Linux Code.

provisions, the minimum rights shall prevail.

courts are agreed  to  be  the  convenient  forum.   In  the  event  of  any
conflicts between foreign law, rules, and  regulations,  and  Canadian  law,
rules, and regulations, Canadian law, rules and  regulations  shall  prevail
and  govern.   The  United  Nations  Convention   on   Contracts   for   the
International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this  License.   If  for  any
reason a court  of  competent  jurisdiction  finds  any  provision  of  this
License or portion thereof, to  be  unenforceable,  that  provision  of  the
License shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to  effect
the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License shall  continue
in full force and effect.
