Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.\n\nWhile redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n10. Commons Clause License Condition.\n\nThe Work is provided to you by the Licensor under this License subject to the following condition:\n\nWithout limiting other conditions in the License, the grant of rights under the License will not include, and the License does not grant to you, the right to Sell the Work or Derivative Works (collectively “Software”).\n\nFor purposes of the foregoing, “Sell” means practicing any or all of the rights granted to you under the License to provide to third parties, for a fee or other consideration (including without limitation fees for hosting or consulting/ support services related to the Software), a product or service whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from the functionality of the Software.
