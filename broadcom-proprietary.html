confidential and proprietary information of Broadcom, and that Licensee's 
protection thereof is an essential condition to Licensee's use and possession 
of the Software.  Licensee shall retain all Confidential Information in 
strict confidence and not disclose it to any third party or use it in any way 
except under a written agreement with terms and conditions at least as 
protective as the terms of this Section.  Licensee will exercise at least the 
same amount of diligence in preserving the secrecy of the Confidential 
Information as it uses in preserving the secrecy of its own most valuable 
confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable diligence.  
Information shall not be considered Confidential Information if and to the 
extent that it: (i) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or 
has entered the public domain through no fault of Licensee; (ii) was known to 
Licensee, without restriction, at the time of disclosure as proven by the 
files of Licensee in existence at the time of disclosure; or (iii) becomes 
known to Licensee, without restriction, from a source other than Broadcom 
without breach of this Agreement by Licensee and otherwise not in violation 
of Broadcom's rights. 
 
5.2.	Return of Confidential Information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all 
documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Broadcom 
Confidential Information and all copies thereof which are in the possession 
of Licensee shall be and remain the property of Broadcom, and shall be 
promptly returned to Broadcom upon written request by Broadcom or upon 
termination of this Agreement.

BROADCOM'S LICENSORS HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR 
OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS 
OF PROFITS, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL BROADCOM'S LIABILITY WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT 
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE FOR 
SOFTWARE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.  THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING 
ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. 
 
7.	MISCELLANEOUS 
 
7.1.	Export Regulations. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE IS 
SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES AND OTHER APPLICABLE EXPORT-RELATED LAWS AND 
REGULATIONS AND THAT YOU MAY NOT EXPORT, RE-EXPORT OR TRANSFER THE SOFTWARE 
OR ANY DIRECT PRODUCT OF THE SOFTWARE EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THOSE LAWS. 
WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, EXPORT, RE-EXPORT OR TRANSFER OF THE SOFTWARE 
TO CUBA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA, SUDAN AND SYRIA IS PROHIBITED. 
 
7.2	Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the 
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, provided, 
however that Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any rights or 
obligation hereunder, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or 
otherwise, without the prior written consent of Broadcom, and any such 
attempted assignment shall be void.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee 
may assign this Agreement to a successor to all or substantially all of its 
business or assets to which this Agreement relates that is not a competitor 
of Broadcom. 
 
7.3.	Governing Law; Venue.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of 
California without regard to any conflict-of-laws rules, and the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby 
excluded.  The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject 
matter hereof shall be the state and federal courts located in the County of 
Orange, California, and both parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and 
venue. 
 
7.4.	Severability.  All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall, if 
possible, be construed in a manner which makes them valid, but in the event 
any term or provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent 
jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability 
of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected if the illegal or 
unenforceable provision does not materially affect the intent of this 
Agreement.  If the illegal or unenforceable provision materially affects the 
intent of the parties to this Agreement, this Agreement shall become 
terminated. 
 
7.5.	Equitable Relief.  Licensee hereby acknowledges that its breach of this 
Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Broadcom 
that may be difficult to ascertain and that a remedy at law would be 
inadequate.  Accordingly, Licensee agrees that Broadcom shall have the right 
to seek and obtain immediate injunctive relief to enforce obligations under 
the Agreement in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have.  
 
7.6.	Waiver.  The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any breach or default 
hereunder shall not constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent breach 
or default. 
 
7.7.	Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement 
between the parties and supersedes any and all prior proposals, agreements 
and representations between them, whether written or oral concerning the 
Software.  This Agreement may be changed only by mutual agreement of the 
parties in writing.</pre><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>&larr;[AppliesTo] Proprietary Free</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(1563)"></div><p>Proprietary Free</p><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div></div></div><h2>forward</h2><div class="tree"><h3>broadcom-proprietary</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(2373)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div><div class="tree"><h3>Broadcom Proprietary License [Same]&rarr;</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(2372)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>Broadcom Proprietary [Same]&rarr;</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(2371)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>LicenseRef-scancode-broadcom-proprietary [Same]&rarr;</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(2370)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div></div></div><h2>dot</h2><pre>digraph {
