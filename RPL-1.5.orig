This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10.

You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed Software.\n\n12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach.

All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\n\n12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as \"Respondent\") alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or\n4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \"Notice Period\") unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\n\n12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\n12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n13.0 Miscellaneous.\n\n13.1 U.S. Government End Users.

Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.\n\n13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof.
