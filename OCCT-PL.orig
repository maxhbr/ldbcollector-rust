Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nPlease read this license carefully and completely before downloading this software. By downloading, using, modifying, distributing and sublicensing this software, you indicate your acceptance to be bound by the terms and conditions of this license.
