All rights reserved.

LIMITED LICENSE GRANTS

1. License for Evaluation Purposes. Sun hereby grants you a fully-paid,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited license (without the
right to sublicense), under Sun's applicable intellectual property
rights to view, download, use and reproduce the Specification only for
the purpose of internal evaluation. This includes (i) developing
applications intended to run on an implementation of the Specification,
provided that such applications do not themselves implement any
portion(s) of the Specification, and (ii) discussing the Specification
with any third party; and (iii) excerpting brief portions of the
Specification in oral or written communications which discuss the
Specification provided that such excerpts do not in the aggregate
constitute a significant portion of the Specification.

2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations. Sun also
grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,
fully paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to
sublicense) under any applicable copyrights or, subject to the
provisions of subsection 4 below, patent rights it may have covering the
Specification to create and/or distribute an Independent Implementation
of the Specification that: (a) fully implements the Specification
including all its required interfaces and functionality; (b) does not
modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or
include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces,
fields or methods within the Licensor Name Space other than those
required/authorized by the Specification or Specifications being
implemented; and (c) passes the Technology Compatibility Kit (including
satisfying the requirements of the applicable TCK Users Guide) for such
Specification ("Compliant Implementation"). In addition, the foregoing
license is expressly conditioned on your not acting outside its scope.
No license is granted hereunder for any other purpose (including, for
example, modifying the Specification, other than to the extent of your
fair use rights, or distributing the Specification to third parties).
Also, no right, title, or interest in or to any trademarks, service
marks, or trade names of Sun or Sun's licensors is granted hereunder.

Java, and Java-related logos, marks and names are trademarks or
registered trademarks of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the U.S. and other
countries.

3. Pass-through Conditions. You need not include limitations (a)-(c)
from the previous paragraph or any other particular "pass through"
requirements in any license You grant concerning the use of your
Independent Implementation or products derived from it. However, except
with respect to Independent Implementations (and products derived from
them) that satisfy limitations (a)-(c) from the previous paragraph, You
may neither: (a) grant or otherwise pass through to your licensees any
licenses under Sun's applicable intellectual property rights; nor (b)
authorize your licensees to make any claims concerning their
implementation's compliance with the Specification in question.

4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses.

a. With respect to any patent claims covered by the license granted
under subparagraph 2 above that would be infringed by all technically
feasible implementations of the Specification, such license is
conditioned upon your offering on fair, reasonable and non-
discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from You, a perpetual,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license under Your patent
rights which are or would be infringed by all technically feasible
implementations of the Specification to develop, distribute and use a
Compliant Implementation.

b With respect to any patent claims owned by Sun and covered by the
license granted under subparagraph 2, whether or not their infringement
can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when implementing the
Specification, such license shall terminate with respect to such claims
if You initiate a claim against Sun that it has, in the course of
performing its responsibilities as the Specification Lead, induced any
other entity to infringe Your patent rights.

c Also with respect to any patent claims owned by Sun and covered by the
license granted under subparagraph 2 above, where the infringement of
such claims can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when
implementing the Specification such license, with respect to such
claims, shall terminate if You initiate a claim against Sun that its
making, having made, using, offering to sell, selling or importing a
Compliant Implementation infringes Your patent rights.

5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement: "Independent
Implementation" shall mean an implementation of the Specification that
neither derives from any of Sun's source code or binary code materials
nor, except with an appropriate and separate license from Sun, includes
any of Sun's source code or binary code materials; "Licensor Name Space"
shall mean the public class or interface declarations whose names begin
with "java", "javax", "com.sun" or their equivalents in any subsequent
naming convention adopted by Sun through the Java Community Process, or
any recognized successors or replacements thereof; and
"Technology Compatibility Kit" or "TCK" shall mean the test suite and
accompanying TCK User's Guide provided by Sun which corresponds to the
Specification and that was available either (i) from Sun 120 days before
the first release of Your Independent Implementation that allows its use
for commercial purposes, or (ii) more recently than 120 days from such
release but against which You elect to test Your implementation of the
Specification.

This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you
breach the Agreement or act outside the scope of the licenses granted
above.

HAVING, IMPLEMENTING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SPECIFICATION, EVEN IF SUN
AND/OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

any claims arising or resulting from: (i) your use of the Specification;
