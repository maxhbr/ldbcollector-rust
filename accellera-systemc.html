REQUIREMENTS OF DISTRIBUTION\n\n4.1 A Recipient may choose to Distribute any Contribution or any compilation of multiple Contributions\n(except for any Code Contributions) under its own license agreement provided that:\n(a) Recipient complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\n(b) As between Recipient and any other Contributor, Recipient assumes all warranties and conditions,\nexpress and implied, and all liability for damages arising out of its Distribution; and\n(c) Recipient makes available to recipients of such Distribution then Source Code for such\nDistributions, and informs them on how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium\ncustomarily used for software exchange.\n4.2 If a Recipient chooses to Distribute any Code Contribution or compilations of Code Contributions\nthen:\n(a) Such Code Contribution must be Distributed under this Agreement; and\n(b) A copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of such Code Contribution.\n4.3 Each Recipient must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Code Contribution so\nDistributed: “Copyright© 1996-[current year here], by all Contributors. All rights reserved.”\n4.4 In addition, each Recipient that creates and Distributes or otherwise transfers a Modification whether\nor not such Modification has been deposited pursuant to Section 3 must identify the originator of such\nModification in a manner that reasonably allows third parties to identify the originator of the Modification.\n4.5 A Recipient may choose to Distribute the Accellera Documentation under its own license agreement,\nprovided that Recipient complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each Recipient must\ninclude the following in a conspicuous location in the Accellera Documentation so Distributed or transferred:\n“Copyright© 1996-[current year here], by Accellera Systems Initiative. All rights reserved.”\nIn addition, each Recipient that creates and Distributes a modification or Derivative work of the Accellera\nDocumentation, whether or not such modification or Derivative work has been contributed pursuant to a\nCopyright Agreement must identify the originator of such modification or Derivative work in a manner that\nreasonably allows third parties to identify the originator of the modification or derivative work.\n\n5. INDEMNIFICATION\n\nAny Recipient which Distributes any Contribution and/or Accellera Release (a “Distributor”) may accept\ncertain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of Contributions Accellera Documentation and Accellera\nReleases, a Distributor shall Distribute such Contributions, Accellera Documentation and Accellera Releases\nin a manner which does not create potential liability for the Contributors. Therefore each Distributor hereby\nagrees to defend and indemnify every Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought\nby a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nDistributor, including but not limited to the terms and conditions under which Distributor offered such\nContributions, Accellera Documentation and/or Accellera Releases in connection with its Distribution thereof.\nThe obligations in this Section 5 do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement of any Contribution, Accellera Documentation or Accellera Release. In\norder to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: (a) promptly notify the Distributor in writing of such\nclaim, and (b) allow the Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Distributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in the defense of any such claim\nat its own expense.\nFor example, a Recipient might include a Contribution in a commercial product offering, Product X. That\nRecipient is then a Distributor. If that Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties,\nsupport, or indemnity or any other license terms related to Product X, those performance claims, offers and\nother terms are such Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this Section 5, the Distributor would have to\ndefend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims, offers, and other terms, and if a\ncourt requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Distributor must pay those damages.\n\n6. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL CONTRIBUTIONS, ACCELLERA\nDOCUMENTATION AND ACCELLERA RELEASES ARE PROVIDED EXCLUSIVELY ON AN “AS IS” BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\nMERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. EACH RECIPIENT IS SOLELY\nRESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ITS USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANY\nCONTRIBUTION, ACCELLERA DOCUMENTATION AND ACCELLERA RELEASE AND ASSUMES ALL\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXERCISE OF RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO THE RISKS AND COSTS OF PROGRAM ERRORS, COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS,\nDAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF DATA, PROGRAMS OR EQUIPMENT, AND UNAVAILABILITY OR\nINTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS. THIS DISCLAIMER OR WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL\nPART OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO USE OF ANY CONTRIBUTION, ACCELLERA DOCUMENTATION OR\nACCELLERA RELEASE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF THE RECIPIENTS, CONTRIBUTORS\nOR ACCELLERA SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT\nLIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE\nUSE OR DISTRIBUTION OF ANY CONTRIBUTION, ACCELLERA DOCUMENTATION OR ACCELLERA\nRELEASE OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT USE\n\nIf Recipient is licensing any computer program on behalf of any unit or agency of the United States\nGovernment, then such computer program is commercial computer software, and, pursuant to FAR 12.212 or\nDFARS 227.7202 and their successors, as applicable, shall be licensed to the Government under the terms and\nconditions of this Agreement.\n\n9. PATENT CLAIMS\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim, counterclaim or declaratory\njudgment claim in a lawsuit) alleging that any Contribution, Accellera Release or combination of\nContributions (excluding combinations of any Contribution with other software or hardware) infringes such\nRecipient's patent(s), then the rights granted to Recipient by each Contributor under Section 2 shall terminate\nas of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n10. TERMINATION\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if Recipient fails to comply with any of the\nmaterial terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time\nafter becoming aware of such noncompliance. If such occurs, Recipient shall cease all use and Distribution of\nany Contributions of any other Contributor, Accellera Documentation and Accellera Releases based upon the\nrights granted to Recipient under this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable. However,\nRecipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to any\nContributions shall survive such termination.\n\n11. LICENSE VERSIONS\n\nAccellera may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each\nnew version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. Any Contribution, Accellera\nDocumentation or Accellera Release may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under\nwhich it was received.

ELECTRONIC ACCEPTANCE\n\nThis Agreement may be executed either electronically or on paper. If this Agreement is executed\nelectronically, by clicking on the “Accept” button, Recipient warrants that it agrees to all of the terms of this\nAgreement, that Recipient is authorized to enter into this Agreement, and that this Agreement is legally\nbinding upon Recipient.

GENERAL\n\nThis Agreement represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all\nprior agreements or representations, oral or written, regarding the subject matter hereof.

LIST OF MARKS\n1. Open SystemC\n2. Open SystemC Initiative\n3. OSCI\n4. SystemC\n5. SystemC Initiative\n6. All logos that incorporate the foregoing word marks\n\nII. PROPER USE OF MARKS\nTrademarks and service marks function as adjectives and generally should not be used as nouns or verbs.\nAccordingly, as often as possible, the Marks should be used as adjectives immediately preceding the generic\nnoun that refers to the service in question. For example:\nThe SystemC® software\nThe OSCI® LRM\nNo Possessives or Plurals. Since they are not nouns, the Marks should never be used in the possessive or\nplural forms. For example, it is not appropriate to write “SystemC’s software.”\nNo Use as Verbs or as Puns. The Marks should never be used as verbs or as puns.\n\nIII. PROPER ATTRIBUTION\nTrademark ownership is attributed in two ways, with the use of a symbol (TM, SM, ®) after the mark and with a\nlegal legend, usually found at the end of a document following the copyright notice. Following are Accellera’s\nrules for symbols and legends to attribute the Marks:\nSymbols:\nWhich Symbol Do I Use?\nThe Marks generally function as trademarks rather than service marks. Unless you are specifically directed\notherwise, please use the ® symbol after the Marks.\nWhere Do I Place the ® Symbol?\nThe ® symbol is placed immediately after the mark, either in superscript or subscript.\nWhen Do I Use the Symbol?\nThe ® symbol is to be used after the Marks in the following instances:\nMost Prominent Uses: A ® symbol is required after prominent uses of the Marks, e.g., in the headlines and\nlarge print text of web pages, advertisements, other promotional materials and press releases, except where\nspace limitations or specific style considerations prevent compliance with this requirement.\nFirst Use in Text: A ® symbol is required after the first use of each Mark in text, e.g. advertising copy or the\nbody of press releases, even though the symbol may have already appeared in the headline or after another\nprominent use of the mark in the same document.\nAll Logos: The ® symbol must appear after all logos incorporating the Marks.\n\nIV. LEGENDS\nAll Marks that appear on a web page or in a press release, advertisement or other written material (whether in\nprint or electronic form) must be attributed in an appropriate legend. The legend may be presented in\n“mouseprint” but must be large enough to be read easily. Legends generally appear at the end of a document or\nthe bottom of a web page but may be placed elsewhere, e.g. the inside covers of documentation.\nThe Accellera Systems Initiative Legend: The following legend should be used in all materials in which any\nof the Marks appear:\n[Insert the Marks] are trademarks or registered trademarks of Accellera Systems Initiative, Inc. in the United\nStates and other countries and are used with permission.\n\nV. MARKS NEVER COMBINED\nThe Marks should never be combined with the marks of any business other than Accellera. The Marks should\nalways appear visually separate from any other marks appearing in the same materials such that each mark\ncreates a distinct commercial impression. It would, for instance, not be appropriate to superimpose the logo of\nanother business over any Accellera logo.\n\nVI. LOGOS\nLogos incorporating the Marks can only be used in the format provided to you by Accellera for incorporation\ninto your materials or web pages. The logos provided to you by Accellera cannot be modified in any way\nwithout Accellera’s prior written approval. Logos copied from Accellera web pages or other materials may not\nto be used. Please contact info@accellera.org to obtain electronic files containing the Accellera logos and to\nask any question regarding the logos.",
