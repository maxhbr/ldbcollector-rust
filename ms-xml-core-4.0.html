END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR MICROSOFT SOFTWARE
Microsoft xml CORE SERVICES (MSXML) 4.0 

IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY: This Microsoft End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Microsoft Corporation for the Microsoft software identified above, which may include computer software, associated media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE").  By downloading, installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA.  If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install or use the SOFTWARE.

The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. Microsoft or its suppliers own the title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the SOFTWARE.  The SOFTWARE is licensed, not sold.

The SOFTWARE consists of two elements:  (1) XML Core Services component ("COMPONENT") which contains, among other items, files with ".dll" extensions  which expose application programming interfaces that provide implementation to read, write, transform and make other manipulations with XML; and (2) MSXML software development kit ("SDK") which may include documentation, sample code, and other information designed to assist in the development of your applications.

1.	GRANT OF LICENSE.  This EULA grants you the following rights:
a.	General. You may install and use any number of copies of the SOFTWARE on any number of computers, including workstations, terminals or other digital electronic devices, for the purpose of designing, developing and testing your application(s) which work in conjunction with XML ("Application(s)"). 
b.	Sample Code. You may modify the portions of the SDK designated as "Sample Code" for the purpose of designing, developing and testing your Application.
c.	Redistribution of SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT.  You may copy and redistribute the SOFTWARE (in its entirety) and/or the COMPONENT (in its entirety) either in conjunction with your Application or standalone in and of itself, subject to the following restrictions and limitations:
(i)	If you redistribute the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT in their entirety, your copy must be a true and complete copy of the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT, including Microsoft’s set up and all copyright notices, logos, end user license agreement and/or trademarks that appear in the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT as received from Microsoft;
(ii)	If you redistribute the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT in conjunction with your Application, your Application must include a valid copyright notice in your own name, which notice shall be sufficient to protect Microsoft’s copyright in the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT;
(iii)	If you redistribute the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT in conjunction with your Application, and if your Application does not display Microsoft’s end user license agreement to your end user, then your Application must be accompanied by license terms that are at least as restrictive as, and as protective of Microsoft as, those contained in this EULA.;
(iv)	You shall not use Microsoft’s name, logo or trademarks to market your Application;
(v)	You shall not modify or alter the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT in any way; provided that you may merge those files in the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT with "msm" extensions into the "msm" files of your Application;
(vi)	You shall not redistribute individual parts or files of the COMPONENT; you must redistribute the COMPONENT in its entirety;
(vii)	You shall not redistribute the SDK separately; the SDK may only be redistributed as part of the SOFTWARE in its entirety; and
(viii)	You agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend Microsoft from and against any claims or lawsuits, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, which arise or result from your distribution of the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT and/or your Application.
d.	Redistribution of Sample Code as Modified by You. You may copy and redistribute any Sample Code that you have modified as described in Section 1(b) above and incorporated into your Application, in both source code form and object code form, subject to the following restrictions and limitations:
(i)	You shall distribute the modified Sample Code only in conjunction with and as part of an Application that adds significant and primary functionality to the Sample Code;
(ii)	You shall not use Microsoft’s name, logo or trademarks to market your Application;
(iii)	You shall to include a valid copyright notice in your own name in your Application, which notice shall be sufficient to protect Microsoft’s copyright in the modified Sample Code; and
