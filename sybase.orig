Sybase Open Watcom Public License version 1.0

1. General; Definitions. This License applies only to the following 
software programs: the open source versions of Sybase's Watcom C/C++ and 
Fortran compiler products ("Software"), which are modified versions of, 
with significant changes from, the last versions made commercially 
available by Sybase. As used in this License:

1.1 "Applicable Patent Rights" mean: (a) in the case where Sybase is the 
grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter 
acquired, owned by or assigned to Sybase and (ii) that cover subject matter 
contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, 
reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b) 
in the case where You are the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that 
are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that 
cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination 
with Original Code.

1.2 "Contributor" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to 
the creation of Modifications.

1.3 "Covered Code" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination 
of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions 
thereof.

1.4 "Deploy" means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other than 
for Your internal research and development (R&D) and/or Personal Use, and 
includes without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of 
Covered Code within Your business or organization except for R&D use and/or 
Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of 
Covered Code by You to any third party in any form or manner.

1.5 "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof
 with code not governed by the terms of this License.

1.6 "Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, 
the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous 
Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous 
Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. When code is 
released as a series of files, a Modification is: (a) any addition to or 
deletion from the contents of a file containing Covered Code; 
and/or (b) 
any new file or other representation of computer program statements that 
contains any part of Covered Code.

1.7 "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work 
as originally made available by Sybase under this License, including the 
Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made 
available by Sybase under this License, and that has been expressly 
identified by Sybase as such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) 
the object code compiled from such Source Code and originally made 
available by Sybase under this License.

1.8 "Personal Use" means use of Covered Code by an individual solely for 
his or her personal, private and non-commercial purposes. An individual's 
use of Covered Code in his or her capacity as an officer, employee, member, 
independent contractor or agent of a corporation, business or organization 
(commercial or non-commercial) does not qualify as Personal Use.

1.9 "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other work 
that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it 
contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to 
control compilation and installation of an executable (object code).

with, You, where "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to
 cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or 
otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.Subject to the terms and 
conditions of this License, Sybase hereby grants You, effective on the 
date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, 
royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Sybase's Applicable 
Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the 
following:

2.1 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and distribute 
Original Code, with or without Modifications, solely for Your internal 
research and development and/or Personal Use, provided that in each 
instance:
(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the 
copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Sybase as they 
appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original 
Code that refer to this License; and
(b) You must retain and reproduce a copy of this License with every copy 
of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You 
may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or 
restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as 
permitted under Section 6.
(c) Whenever reasonably feasible you should include the copy of this 
License in a click-wrap format, which requires affirmative acceptance by 
clicking on an "I accept" button or similar mechanism. If a click-wrap 
format is not included, you must include a statement that any use 
(including without limitation reproduction, modification or distribution) 
of the Software, and any other affirmative act that you define, constitutes 
acceptance of the License, and instructing the user not to use the Covered 
Code in any manner if the user does not accept all of the terms and 
conditions of the License.

2.2 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code, 
provided that in each instance:
(a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the 
Source Code of the Covered Code;
(b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice 
in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and 
cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You 
changed the files and the date of any change;
(c) You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications publicly 
available under the terms of this License, including the license grants 
set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code 
or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is 
longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed 
Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site);
(d) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You 
must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related 
documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available 
under the terms of this License with information on how and where to 
obtain such Source Code; and
(e) the object code form of the Covered Code may be distributed under Your 
own license agreement, provided that such license agreement contains terms 
no less protective of Sybase and each Contributor than the terms of this 
License, and stating that any provisions which differ from this License 
are offered by You alone and not by any other party.

2.3 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Sybase and each 
Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered 
Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Sybase or any 
Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other 
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Sybase and each 
Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other 
entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. 
As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, 
You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual 
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent 
license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is 
Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered 
Code.

3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses 
granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to Sybase and all 
third parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Your Applicable 
Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) 
owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, 
distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as 
Sybase's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2.

4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code 
with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute 
the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make 
sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code 
or any portion thereof.

5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, 
no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Sybase herein. 
Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses 
from Sybase which Sybase may grant in its sole discretion.

6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights 
consistent with this License ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients 
of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as 
Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Sybase or any Contributor. 
You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms 
are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and 
hold Sybase and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by 
or claims asserted against Sybase or such Contributor by reason of any 
such Additional Terms.

7. Versions of the License. Sybase may publish revised and/or new versions 
of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under 
a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the 
terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under 
the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Sybase. No 
one other than Sybase has the right to modify the terms applicable to 
Covered Code created under this License.

8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part 
pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may 
contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be 
incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that 
use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire 
risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES 
OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND SYBASE AND SYBASE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY 
REFERRED TO AS "SYBASE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL 
CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR 
CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT 
OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. SYBASE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT 
AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE 
FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT 
THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR 
THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN 
INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY SYBASE, A SYBASE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE 
OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the 
Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, 
aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control 
machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death,
 personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO 
EVENT SHALL SYBASE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT 
OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED 
CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, 
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF 
SYBASE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. 
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL 
OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT 
APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Sybase's or any Contributor's total 
liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by 
applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of five hundred 
dollars ($500.00).

10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the 
trademarks or trade names "Sybase" or any other trademarks or trade names 
belonging to Sybase (collectively "Sybase Marks") or to any trademark or 
trade name belonging to any Contributor("Contributor Marks"). No Sybase 
Marks or Contributor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products 
derived from the Original Code or Covered Code other than with the prior 
written consent of Sybase or the Contributor, as applicable.

11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor 
retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such 
Contributor. Sybase retains all rights, title and interest in and to the 
Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Sybase ("Sybase 
Modifications"), and such Sybase Modifications will not be automatically 
subject to this License. Sybase may, at its sole discretion, choose to 
license such Sybase Modifications under this License, or on different terms 
from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at 
all.

12. Termination.

12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will 
terminate:
(a) automatically without notice if You fail to comply with any term(s) of 
this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 
aware of such breach;
(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 
13.5(b); or
(c) automatically without notice if You, at any time during the term of 
this License, commence an action for patent infringement (including as a 
cross claim or counterclaim) against Sybase or any Contributor.

12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately 
stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and 
distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered 
Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered 
Code that have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any 
termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should 
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, 
including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No 
party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages 
of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance 
with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice 
to any other right or remedy of any party.

13. Miscellaneous.

13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as 
defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the 
Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public 
as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical 
data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical
