ANY COVERED CODE THAT YOU DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION SECTION 2.2. THE SOURCE CODE VERSION OF COVERED CODE MAY BE DISTRIBUTED ONLY UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE OR A FUTURE VERSION OF THIS LICENSE RELEASED UNDER SECTION 6.1, AND YOU MUST INCLUDE A COPY OF THIS LICENSE WITH EVERY COPY OF THE SOURCE CODE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE.

3.2. Availability of Source Code

ANY MODIFICATION WHICH YOU CREATE OR TO WHICH YOU CONTRIBUTE MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE IN SOURCE CODE FORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE EITHER ON THE SAME MEDIA AS AN EXECUTABLE VERSION OR VIA AN ACCEPTED ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM TO ANYONE TO WHOM YOU MADE AN EXECUTABLE VERSION AVAILABLE; AND IF MADE AVAILABLE VIA ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM, MUST REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR AT LEAST TWELVE (12) MONTHS AFTER THE DATE IT INITIALLY BECAME AVAILABLE, OR AT LEAST SIX (6) MONTHS AFTER A SUBSEQUENT VERSION OF THAT PARTICULAR MODIFICATION HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO SUCH RECIPIENTS.

YOU MAY CHOOSE TO OFFER, AND TO CHARGE A FEE FOR, WARRANTY, SUPPORT, INDEMNITY OR LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS TO ONE OR MORE RECIPIENTS OF COVERED CODE. HOWEVER, YOU MAY DO SO ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF, AND NOT ON BEHALF OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR. YOU MUST MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAN ANY SUCH WARRANTY, SUPPORT, INDEMNITY OR LIABILITY OBLIGATION IS OFFERED BY YOU ALONE, AND YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER AND EVERY CONTRIBUTOR FOR ANY LIABILITY INCURRED BY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR AS A RESULT OF WARRANTY, SUPPORT, INDEMNITY OR LIABILITY TERMS YOU OFFER.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions

YOU MAY DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE COVERED CODE IN EXECUTABLE FORM ONLY IF THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTIONS 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 AND 3.5 HAVE BEEN MET FOR THAT COVERED CODE, AND IF YOU INCLUDE A NOTICE STATING THAT THE SOURCE CODE VERSION OF THE COVERED CODE IS AVAILABLE UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF HOW AND WHERE YOU HAVE FULFILLED THE OBLIGATIONS OF SECTION 3.2. THE NOTICE MUST BE CONSPICUOUSLY INCLUDED IN ANY NOTICE IN AN EXECUTABLE VERSION, RELATED DOCUMENTATION OR COLLATERAL IN WHICH YOU DESCRIBE RECIPIENTS' RIGHTS RELATING TO THE COVERED CODE. YOU MAY DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE THE EXECUTABLE VERSION OF COVERED CODE OR OWNERSHIP RIGHTS UNDER A LICENSE OF YOUR CHOICE, WHICH MAY CONTAIN TERMS DIFFERENT FROM THIS LICENSE, PROVIDED THAT YOU ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AND THAT THE LICENSE FOR THE EXECUTABLE VERSION DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO LIMIT OR ALTER THE RECIPIENT'S RIGHTS IN THE SOURCE CODE VERSION FROM THE RIGHTS SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE.

6.3. Derivative Works of License; Antecedent Licenses

IF YOU CREATE OR USE A MODIFIED VERSION OF THIS LICENSE (WHICH YOU MAY ONLY DO IN ORDER TO APPLY IT TO CODE WHICH IS NOT ALREADY COVERED CODE GOVERNED BY THIS LICENSE), YOU MUST (A) RENAME YOUR LICENSE SO THAT THE PHRASES "TERRACOTTA", "TPL", OR ANY CONFUSINGLY SIMILAR PHRASE DO NOT APPEAR IN YOUR LICENSE (EXCEPT TO NOTE THAT YOUR LICENSE DIFFERS FROM THIS LICENSE) AND (B) OTHERWISE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOUR VERSION OF THE LICENSE CONTAINS TERMS WHICH DIFFER FROM THE TERRACOTTA PUBLIC LICENSE. (FILLING IN THE NAME OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL CODE OR CONTRIBUTOR IN THE NOTICE DESCRIBED IN EXHIBIT A SHALL NOT OF THEMSELVES BE DEEMED TO BE MODIFICATIONS OF THIS LICENSE.)

THIS TERRACOTTA PUBLIC LICENSE (TPL) IS SIMILAR TO, AND CONTAINS SAMPLES FROM, THE MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE (MPL) AND THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL). HOWEVER, THIS TPL CONTAINS TERMS WHICH DIFFER FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN THE MPL AND THE CDDL.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. Termination

8.1. THIS LICENSE AND THE RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER WILL TERMINATE AUTOMATICALLY IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLY WITH TERMS HEREIN AND FAIL TO CURE SUCH BREACH WITHIN 30 DAYS OF BECOMING AWARE OF THE BREACH. ALL SUBLICENSES TO THE COVERED CODE WHICH ARE PROPERLY GRANTED SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE. PROVISIONS WHICH, BY THEIR NATURE, MUST REMAIN IN EFFECT BEYOND THE TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE SHALL SURVIVE.

8.2. IF YOU INITIATE LITIGATION BY ASSERTING A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM (EXCLUDING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTIONS) AGAINST INITIAL DEVELOPER OR A CONTRIBUTOR (THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR CONTRIBUTOR AGAINST WHOM YOU FILE SUCH ACTION IS REFERRED TO AS "PARTICIPANT") ALLEGING THAT:

a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (1) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (2) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

8.3. IF YOU ASSERT A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST PARTICIPANT ALLEGING THAT SUCH PARTICIPANT'S CONTRIBUTOR VERSION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INFRINGES ANY PATENT WHERE SUCH CLAIM IS RESOLVED (SUCH AS BY LICENSE OR SETTLEMENT) PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION, THEN THE REASONABLE VALUE OF THE LICENSES GRANTED BY SUCH PARTICIPANT UNDER SECTIONS 2.1 OR 2.2 SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OR VALUE OF ANY PAYMENT OR LICENSE.

8.4. IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION UNDER SECTIONS 8.1 OR 8.2 ABOVE, ALL END USER LICENSE AGREEMENTS (EXCLUDING DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS) WHICH HAVE BEEN VALIDLY GRANTED BY YOU OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR HEREUNDER PRIOR TO TERMINATION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION.

9. Limitation of Liability

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES IN WHICH AT LEAST ONE PARTY IS A CITIZEN OF, OR AN ENTITY CHARTERED OR REGISTERED TO DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ANY LITIGATION RELATING TO THIS LICENSE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, WITH VENUE LYING IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, WITH THE LOSING PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR COSTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, COURT COSTS AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES.
