appropriate licensing from such third parties.


7. LIMITED WARRANTY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

The Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee "as is". To the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, Digia on behalf of itself and its
suppliers, disclaims all warranties and conditions, either express or
implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
non-infringement with regard to the Licensed Software.


8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

return of the price Licensee paid for the Licensed Software, or (B)
repair or replacement of the Licensed Software, provided Licensee
returns to Digia all copies of the Licensed Software as originally
delivered to Licensee. Digia shall not under any circumstances be liable
to Licensee based on failure of the Licensed Software if the failure

Each party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement it shall
have access to information about the other party's business, business
methods, business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and
other information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is
confidential and of great value to the other party, and the value of
which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties (the
"Confidential Information"). Accordingly, when a party (the "Receiving
Party") receives Confidential Information from another party (the
"Disclosing Party"), the Receiving Party shall, and shall obligate its
employees and agents and employees and agents of its Affiliates to: (i)
maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) not
disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the
Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or
indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than
for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant
to this Agreement. Each party shall take reasonable measures to protect
the Confidential Information of the other party, which measures shall
not be less than the measures taken by such party to protect its own
confidential and proprietary information.

"Confidential Information" shall not include information that (a) is or
becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the
Receiving Party; (b) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession
prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on
disclosure or use; (c) is developed by the Receiving Party without
access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party or by
persons who have not had access to the Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party as proven by the written records of the Receiving
Party; (d) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without
restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of
confidentiality; or (e) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to
disclose the information, in which case the Receiving Party shall assert
the privileged and confidential nature of the information and cooperate
fully with the Disclosing Party to protect against and prevent
disclosure of any Confidential Information and to limit the scope of
disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information
by all legally available means.

The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Section shall continue
during the Initial Term and for a period of five (5) years after
expiration or termination of this Agreement. To the extent that the
terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement between Digia and Licensee
conflict with the terms of this Section 9, this Section 9 shall be
controlling over the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

should survive a cancellation or termination of this Agreement shall
also be deemed to survive. Such terms and conditions include, but are
not limited to the following Sections: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4,

party. No term or condition contained in Licensee's purchase order shall

the State of New York without given effect to any choice of law rule
that would result in the application of the laws of any other
jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall not apply. Each Party (a)
hereby irrevocably submits itself to and consents to the jurisdiction of
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
(or if such court lacks jurisdiction, the state courts of the State of
New York) for the purposes of any action, claim, suit or proceeding
between the Parties in connection with any controversy, claim, or
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement; and (b) hereby
waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise, in any such action, claim, suit or proceeding, any claim that
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such court(s), that the
action, claim, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or
that the venue of the action, claim, suit or proceeding is improper.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9.6 is intended
to, or shall be deemed to, constitute a submission or consent to, or
selection of, jurisdiction, forum or venue for any action for patent
infringement, whether or not such action relates to this Agreement.

10.7    No Implied License

There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this
Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder,

9.  CONFIDENTIALITY

Each party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement it shall
have access to information about the other party's business, business
methods, business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and
other information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is
confidential and of great value to the other party, and the value of
which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties (the
"Confidential Information"). Accordingly, when a party (the "Receiving
Party") receives Confidential Information from another party (the
"Disclosing Party"), the Receiving Party shall, and shall obligate its
employees and agents and employees and agents of its Affiliates to: (i)
maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) not
disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the
Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or
indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than
for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant
to this Agreement. Each party shall take reasonable measures to protect
the Confidential Information of the other party, which measures shall
not be less than the measures taken by such party to protect its own
confidential and proprietary information.

"Confidential Information" shall not include information that (a) is or
becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the
Receiving Party; (b) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession
prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on
disclosure or use; (c) is developed by the Receiving Party without
access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party or by
persons who have not had access to the Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party as proven by the written records of the Receiving
Party; (d) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without
restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of
confidentiality; or (e) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to
disclose the information, in which case the Receiving Party shall assert
the privileged and confidential nature of the information and cooperate
fully with the Disclosing Party to protect against and prevent
disclosure of any Confidential Information and to limit the scope of
disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information
by all legally available means.

The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Section shall continue
during the Initial Term and for a period of five (5) years after
expiration or termination of this Agreement. To the extent that the
terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement between Digia and Licensee
conflict with the terms of this Section 9, this Section 9 shall be
controlling over the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.
