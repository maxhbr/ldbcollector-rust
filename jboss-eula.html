These third party \nprograms are subject to their own license terms.  The license terms either accompany the programs or \ncan be viewed at http://www.redhat.com/licenses/.  If Client does not agree to abide by the applicable \nlicense terms for such programs, then Client may not install them.  If Client wishes to install the programs \non more than one system or transfer the programs to another party, then Client must contact the licensor \nof the programs.\n\n7.  General.  If any provision of this agreement is held to be unenforceable, that shall not affect the \nenforceability of the remaining provisions.
