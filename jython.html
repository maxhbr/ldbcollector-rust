B. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
=======================================================

JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the
primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw
took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.

In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed
under the Jython specific license below.

From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed
Python Software Foundation contributor agreements and releases are
covered under the Python Software Foundation license version 2.

The standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation
license as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details.

The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed
under the GNU Public License.  The package is now covered by the Jython
Software License.

The command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software
License.  See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.</pre><h5>Edge Origins:</h5><h5>Node Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>&larr;[AppliesTo] Permissive</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(1033)"></div><pre>LicenseType(
