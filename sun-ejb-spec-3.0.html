paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited license
(without the right to sublicense), under Sun’s applicable intellectual
property rights to view, download, use and reproduce the Specification
only for the purpose of internal evaluation. This includes (i)
developing applications intended to run on an implementation of the
Specification, provided that such applications do not themselves
implement any portion(s) of the Specification, and (ii) discussing the
Specification with any third party; and (iii) excerpting brief portions
of the Specification in oral or written communications which discuss the
Specification provided that such excerpts do not in the aggregate
constitute a significant portion of the Specification.

2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations. Sun also
grants you a perpetual, nonexclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, fully
paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to sublicense)
under any applicable copyrights or, subject to the provisions of

4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses.

a. With respect to any patent claims covered by the license granted
under subparagraph 2 above that would be infringed by all technically
feasible implementations of the Specification, such license is
conditioned upon your offering on fair, reasonable and non-
discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from You, a perpetual,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license under Your patent
rights which are or would be infringed by all technically feasible
implementations of the Specification to develop, distribute and use a
Compliant Implementation.

b With respect to any patent claims owned by Sun and covered by the
license granted under subparagraph 2, whether or not their infringement
can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when implementing the
Specification, such license shall terminate with respect to such claims
if You initiate a claim against Sun that it has, in the course of
performing its responsibilities as the Specification Lead, induced any
other entity to infringe Your patent rights.

c Also with respect to any patent claims owned by Sun and covered by the
license granted under subparagraph 2 above, where the infringement of
such claims can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when
implementing the Specification such license, with respect to such
claims, shall terminate if You initiate a claim against Sun that its
making, having made, using, offering to sell, selling or importing a
Compliant Implementation infringes Your patent rights.

5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement: "Independent
Implementation" shall mean an implementation of the Specification that
neither derives from any of Sun’s source code or binary code materials
nor, except with an appropriate and separate license from Sun, includes
any of Sun’s source code or binary code materials; "Licensor Name Space"
shall mean the public class or interface declarations whose names begin
with "java", "javax", "com.sun" or their equivalents in any subsequent
naming convention adopted by Sun through the Java Community Process, or
any recognized successors or replacements thereof; and "Technology
Compatibility Kit" or "TCK" shall mean the test suite and accompanying
TCK User’s Guide provided by Sun which corresponds to the Specification

release of Your Independent Implementation that allows its use for
commercial purposes, or (ii) more recently than 120 days from such
release but against which You elect to test Your implementation of the
Specification.

This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you
breach the Agreement or act outside the scope of the licenses granted
above.
