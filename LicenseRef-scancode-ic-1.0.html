1. Definitions

   The terms “reproduce,” “reproduction,” “derivative works,” and “distribution”
   have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.

   A “contribution” is the original software, or any additions or changes to the
   software.

   A “contributor” is any person that distributes its contribution under this
   license.

   “Internet Computer” is the decentralized compute platform originated by the
   DFINITY Foundation and stewarded by the Internet Computer Association.

2. Grant of Rights

   (A) Copyright Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the
   license conditions and limitations in Section 3, each contributor grants you
   a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its
   contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute
   its contribution or any derivative works that you create.

   (B) Patent Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the
   license conditions and limitations in Section 3, each contributor grants you
   a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents
   to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise
   dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the
   contribution in the software.

3. Conditions and Limitations

   (A) Platform Limitation - The licenses granted in sections 2(A) and 2(B)
   extend only to the software or derivative works that you create that run
   directly on the Internet Computer platform.

   (B) This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors’ name,
   logo, or trademarks.

   (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all
   copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the
   software.

   (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you
   may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this
   license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software
   in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that
   complies with this license.

   (E) If you have modified the Software or created derivative works, and
   distribute such modifications or derivative works, you will cause the
   modified files to carry prominent notices so that recipients know that they
   are not receiving the original software. Such notices must state: (i) that
   you have changed the software; and (ii) the date of any changes.

   (F) THE SOFTWARE COMES "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES. THIS MEANS THE

   OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ALSO, YOU
   MUST PASS THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY ON WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE

   (H) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you
   claim are infringed by the software or a claim against anyone for their use

   in any way.

   (J) Each contributor grants to the Foundation the right to distribute the
   contribution of the contributor under a license which is more permissive than
   this license. A more permissive license shall be in particular a license with
   less restrictions on how the contribution can be reproduced, modified and
   distributed than this license. A more permissive license may be in particular
   understood as a license that sets asides the platform limitation in section 3
   (A) of this license. A more permissive license shall include in particular
   the Apache License Version 2.0 (or future versions thereof) and the MIT
   License. The decision on such a distribution under a more permissive license
   is at the sole discretion of the Foundation

   (K) The Foundation reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this
   license.
