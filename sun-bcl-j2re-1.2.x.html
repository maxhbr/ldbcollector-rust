PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT 
TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

5.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, 
IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE,
PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL 
OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF
LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO 
USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in
contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount
paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential purpose.

6.  Termination.  This Agreement is effective until terminated.  You

which case this Agreement will immediately terminate.

11.  Integration.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between you

contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals,
representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or
