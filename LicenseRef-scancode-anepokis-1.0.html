As an express condition for the grants of\nlicense hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original\nWork or a Derivative Work as a distribution under Section 1(c).\n\n6.

Nothing in this License is intended to\naffect copyright exceptions and limitations (including \"fair use\" or \"fair\ndealing\"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer\nexercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to\nhonor the conditions in Section 1(c).\n\n10.
