    "Oracle Technology Network License Agreement\n\nOracle is willing to authorize Your access to software associated with this License Agreement (\"Agreement\") only upon the condition that You accept that this Agreement governs Your use of the software. By selecting the \"Accept License Agreement\" button or box (or the equivalent) or installing or using the Programs You indicate Your acceptance of this Agreement and Your agreement, as an authorized representative of Your company or organization (if being acquired for use by an entity) or as an individual, to comply with the license terms that apply to the software that You wish to download and access. If You are not willing to be bound by this Agreement, do not select the \"Accept License Agreement\" button or box (or the equivalent) and do not download or access the software.\n\nDefinitions \n\"Oracle\" refers to Oracle America, Inc. \"You\" and \"Your\" refers to (a) a company or organization (each an \"Entity\") accessing the Programs, if use of the Programs will be on behalf of such Entity; or (b) an individual accessing the Programs, if use of the Programs will not be on behalf of an Entity. \"Contractors\" refers to Your agents and contractors (including, without limitation, outsourcers). \"Program(s)\" refers to Oracle software provided by Oracle pursuant to this Agreement and any updates, error corrections, and/or Program Documentation provided by Oracle. \"Program Documentation\" refers to Program user manuals and Program installation manuals, if any. If available, Program Documentation may be delivered with the Programs and/or may be accessed from www.oracle.com/documentation. \"Associated Product\" refers to the Oracle product(s), if any, and as identified in the Programs documentation or on the Programs download site, with which the Programs are intended to enable or enhance interoperation with Your application(s). \"Separate Terms\" refers to separate license terms that are specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice files and that apply to Separately Licensed Third Party Technology. \"Separately Licensed Third Party Technology\" refers to third party technology that is licensed under Separate Terms and not under the terms of this Agreement.\n\nLicense Rights and Restrictions\nOracle grants You a nonexclusive, nontransferable, limited license to, subject to the restrictions stated in this Agreement, (a) internally use the Programs solely for the purposes of developing, testing, prototyping and demonstrating Your applications, and running the Programs for Your own internal business operations; and (b) redistribute unmodified Programs and Programs Documentation pursuant to the Programs Redistribution section below. You may allow Your Contractor(s) to use the Programs, provided they are acting on Your behalf to exercise license rights granted in this Agreement and further provided that You are responsible for their compliance with this Agreement in such use. You will have a written agreement with Your Contractor(s) that strictly limits their right to use the Programs and that otherwise protects Oracle’s intellectual property rights to the same extent as this Agreement. You may make copies of the Programs to the extent reasonably necessary to exercise the license rights granted in this Agreement. You may make one copy of the Programs for backup purposes.\n\nFurther, You may not:\n\nremove or modify any Program markings or any notice of Oracle’s or a licensor’s proprietary rights;\nuse the Programs to provide third party training;\nassign this Agreement or distribute, give, or transfer the Programs or an interest in them to any third party, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement (the foregoing shall not be construed to limit the rights You may otherwise have with respect to Separately Licensed Third Party Technology);\ncause or permit reverse engineering (unless required by law for interoperability), disassembly or decompilation of the Programs; and\ndisclose results of any Program benchmark tests without Oracle’s prior consent.\nThe Programs may contain source code that, unless expressly licensed in this Agreement for other purposes (for example, licensed under an open source license), is provided solely for reference purposes pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and may not be modified.\n\nAll rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by Oracle. If You want to use the Programs or Your application for any purpose other than as expressly permitted under this Agreement, You must obtain from Oracle or an Oracle reseller a valid Programs license under a separate agreement permitting such use. However, You acknowledge that the Programs may not be intended for production use and/or Oracle may not make a version of the Programs available for production or other purposes; any development or other work You undertake with the Programs is at Your sole risk.\n\nPrograms Redistribution \nWe grant You a nonexclusive, nontransferable right to copy and distribute unmodified Programs and Programs Documentation as part of and included in Your application that is intended to interoperate with the Associated Product, if any, provided that You do not charge Your end users any additional fees for the use of the Programs. Prior to distributing the Programs and Programs Documentation, You shall require Your end users to execute an agreement binding them to terms, with respect to the Programs and Programs Documentation, materially consistent and no less restrictive than those contained in this section and the sections of this Agreement entitled \"License Rights\" (except that the redistribution right granted to You shall not be included; Your end users may not distribute Programs and Programs Documentation to any third parties), \"Ownership and Restrictions,\" \"Export Controls,\" \"Disclaimer of Warranties and Exclusive Remedies,\" \"No Technical Support\" (with respect to Oracle support; You may provide Your own support for Programs at Your discretion), \"End of Agreement,\" \"Relationship Between the Parties,\" \"Open Source Software,\" and \"U.S. Government End Users.\" You must also include a provision stating that Your end users shall have no right to distribute the Programs and Programs Documentation, and a provision specifying us as a third party beneficiary of the agreement. You are responsible for obtaining these agreements with Your end users.\n\nYou agree to: (a) defend and indemnify us against all claims and damages caused by Your distribution of the Programs and Programs Documentation in breach of this Agreement and/or failure to include the required contractual provisions in Your end user agreement as stated above; (b) keep executed end user agreements and records of end user information including name, address, date of distribution and identity of Programs distributed; (c) allow us to inspect Your end user agreements and records upon request; and, (d) enforce the terms of Your end user agreements so as to effect a timely cure of any end user breach, and to notify us of any breach of the terms.\n\nOwnership\nOracle or its licensors retain all ownership and intellectual property rights to the Programs.\n\nThird-Party Technology \nThe Programs may contain or require the use of third party technology that is provided with the Programs. Oracle may provide certain notices to You in Program Documentation, readmes or notice files in connection with such third party technology. Third party technology will be licensed to You either under the terms of this Agreement or, if specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice files, under Separate Terms. Your rights to use Separately Licensed Third Party Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted in any way by this Agreement. However, for clarity, notwithstanding the existence of a notice, third party technology that is not Separately Licensed Third Party Technology shall be deemed part of the Programs and is licensed to You under the terms of this Agreement.\n\nSource Code for Open Source Software \nFor software that You receive from Oracle in binary form that is licensed under an open source license that gives You the right to receive the source code for that binary, You can obtain a copy of the applicable source code from https://oss.oracle.com/sources/ or http://www.oracle.com/goto/opensourcecode.
