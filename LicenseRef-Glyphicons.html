By downloading icons from GLYPHICONS.com you agree to be bound by the terms of this license terms.

The license is non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable and it is always tied with one email address, unique order ID (you may find this number in your first email with download link) and the name of the customer.

Customer can be either a natural person (individual human being) or a legal person (company/business).

This license is intended only for end customers; therefore you cannot purchase icons on behalf of someone else. GLYPHICONS.com does not cooperate with any resellers, each customer have to buy license directly.

What is allowed
You may use icons in personal or commercial projects, repeatedly and you do not need to buy an extra license for every new project.

Every customer can lend icons to officially contracted employees during the time they work in your company, but you are fully responsible for how they are being used.

The price includes future updates of the product, which means that no additional purchase is required and you will receive new updates automatically in your mailbox as soon, as the new version is available.

You do not have to indicate the name of the author or giving any credits to GLYPHICONS.com, although it is always appreciated.

What is not allowed
You cannot use icons in any product intended for further processing or where your customer is not a final owner. It is strictly prohibited to bundle icons in any HTML themes, frameworks, as a library of shapes/images or wherever icons would generate a significant value of the final product.

Also, it isn’t possible to use them on a product where the icons would be used repeatedly in larger series. For example as prints of t-shirts, mugs, posters or any other product which have a character of repeated production.

It is not allowed to resell the icons (license) as such, because the icons remain the intellectual property of the author.

Any other use must be approved in writing. It is not possible to request any changes in this license before or after the purchase.

If customer violates any terms and conditions in this license, it will terminate this license automatically.

All icons are provided "as they are" without a warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. GLYPHICONS.com is not liable for any damages or loss of profits (earnings) caused of any defects in these icon sets.
