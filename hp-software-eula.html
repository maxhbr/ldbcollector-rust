b.     This Agreement confers no title or ownership and is not a sale of any rights in the Software. Third-party suppliers are intended beneficiaries under this Agreement and independently may protect their rights in the Software in the event of any infringement.  All rights not expressly granted to You are reserved solely to HP or its suppliers.  Nothing herein should be construed as granting You, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, a license relating to Software other than as expressly stated above in this section 2.
c.     Unless otherwise permitted by HP, You (a) may only make copies or adaptations of the Software for archival purposes or when copying or adaptation is an essential step in the authorized Use of the Software on a backup device, provided that copies and adaptations are used in no other manner and provided further that the Use on the backup device is discontinued when the original or replacement device becomes operable, and (b) may not copy the Software onto or otherwise Use or make it available on, to, or through any public or external distributed network.

4.        INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT FOR SOFTWARE PROVIDED FOR A LICENSE FEE: 

a.     In the event Software was provided to You for a License Fee, HP will defend or settle any claim against You alleging that HP Branded Software products provided under this Agreement infringes intellectual property rights in the country where they were sold, if You:
1.   promptly notify HP of the claim in writing;

3.   grant HP sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim.
HP will pay infringement claim defense costs, HP–negotiated settlement amounts, and court-awarded damages.

If such a claim appears likely, then HP may modify the HP Branded Software products, procure any necessary license, or replace the affected item with one that is at least functionally equivalent. If HP determines that none of these alternatives is reasonably available, then HP will issue You a refund equal to the purchase price paid for the affected item if within one year of delivery, or Your net book value thereafter.
c.     HP has no obligation for any claim of infringement arising from:
1.   HP’s compliance with Your or third party designs, specifications, instructions, or technical information;

Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. 

6.     TERMINATION
This Agreement is effective unless terminated or rejected.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement will also terminate upon conditions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement or if You fail to comply with any term or condition hereof.  Immediately upon termination You will destroy the Software and all copies of the Software or return them to HP.

You may not assign, sublicense, delegate or otherwise transfer ("Assign") all or any part of this Agreement without prior written consent from HP, payment to HP of any applicable fees, and compliance with HP's Software license transfer policies and any applicable third party license terms.  Any such attempted Assignment will be null and void.  Where an authorized Assignment occurs in accordance with this section, Your rights under this Agreement will terminate, and You will immediately deliver the Software and all copies to the Assignee. The Assignee must agree in writing to the terms of this Agreement, and the transferee thereafter will be considered "You" for purposes of this Agreement. You may transfer firmware only upon transfer of the associated hardware.

HP may suspend performance if You are in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.
d.     You agree that HP may audit Your compliance with this Agreement.  Any such audit would be at HP’s expense, require reasonable notice, and would be performed during normal business hours.

e.     This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding rules as to choice and conflict of law.  You and HP agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement.
f.      Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, this Agreement is the entire agreement between HP and You regarding Your Use of the Software, and supersedes and replaces any previous communications, representations, or agreements, or Your additional or inconsistent terms, whether oral or written. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable the remainder of the Agreement will remain enforceable and unaffected thereby.
g.     HP’s failure to exercise or delay in exercising any of its rights under this Agreement will not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of those rights.</pre><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>&larr;[AppliesTo] Proprietary Free</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(1563)"></div><p>Proprietary Free</p><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div></div></div><h2>forward</h2><div class="tree"><h3>hp-software-eula</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(4704)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div><div class="tree"><h3>HP Software EULA [Same]&rarr;</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(4703)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>LicenseRef-scancode-hp-software-eula [Same]&rarr;</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(4702)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div></div></div><h2>dot</h2><pre>digraph {
