                ========================================


Notice
------


This Agreement is a free software license that is the result of  discussions
between its authors  in  order  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  two  main
principles guiding its drafting:
   - firstly, its conformity with French law, both as  regards  the  law  of
     torts and intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers
     to authors and the holders of economic rights over software.
   - secondly, compliance with the principles for the distribution  of  free
     software: access to source codes, extended user-rights.

The following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C :
CNRS, I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel Libre):

Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical  and
industrial establishment, having its principal place of  business  at  31-33
rue de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex 15, France.

Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique -  CNRS,  a  public  scientific
and technological establishment, having its principal place of  business  at
3 rue Michel-Ange 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.

Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA,  a
public scientific and  technological  establishment,  having  its  principal
place of business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt,  BP  105,  78153  Le
Chesnay cedex.


PREAMBLE
--------


The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users  the
right to modify and redistribute  the  software  governed  by  this  license
within the framework of an "open source" distribution model.

The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain  obligations  for
users  so  as  to  ensure  that  this  status  is  retained  for  subsequent
redistribution operations.

As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify
and redistribute granted by the license,  users are provided only with  a
limited warranty and  the software's author, the holder of the economic
rights,  and  the  successive licensors only have limited liability.

In this respect, it is brought to the user's attention that the risks
associated  with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing
the  software  by the user given its nature of Free Software,  that  may  
mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means 
that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having
in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test
the Software's suitability  as  regards  their  requirements  in  conditions
enabling  the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more
generally,  to use and operate  it  in  the  same  conditions  of security.
This Agreement may be  freely  reproduced  and  published, provided  it  is
not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom. 

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of  the
economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.


Article 1  - DEFINITIONS
------------------------


For the purposes of this Agreement, when the following expressions  commence
with a capital letter, they shall have the following meaning:

Agreement: means this Licensing Agreement, and any or all of its  subsequent
versions.

Software: means the software in its Object  Code  and/or  Source  Code  form
and, where applicable, its documentation, "as  is"  at  the  time  when  the
Licensee accepts the Agreement.

Initial Software: means the Software in its Source Code and/or  Object  Code
form and, where applicable, its documentation, "as is" at the time  when  it
is distributed for the first time under the  terms  and  conditions  of  the
Agreement.

Modified  Software:  means  the  Software   modified   by   at   least   one
Contribution.

Source Code: means all the Software's  instructions  and  program  lines  to
which access is required so as to modify the Software.

Object Code: means the binary files originating from the compilation of  the
Source Code.

Holder: means  the  holder  of  the  economic  rights  over  the  Initial
Software.

Licensee(s): mean(s) the Software user(s) having accepted the Agreement.

Contributor: means a Licensee having made at least one Contribution.

Licensor: means the Holder, or any or all other individual or legal  entity,
that distributes the Software under the Agreement.

Contributions: mean any or  all  modifications,  corrections,  translations,
adaptations and/or new functionalities integrated into the Software  by  any
or all Contributor, and the Static Modules.

Module: means a set of sources files  including  their  documentation  that,
once compiled in executable form, enables supplementary  functionalities  or
services to be developed in addition to those offered by the Software.

Dynamic Module: means any or all module, created by  the  Contributor,  that
is independent of the Software, so that this module and the Software are  in
two different executable forms that are  run  in  separate  address  spaces,
with one calling the other when they are run.

Static Module: means any or all  module,  created  by  the  Contributor  and
connected to the Software by a static link that  makes  their  object  codes
interdependent. This module and the Software to which it is  connected,  are
combined in a single executable.

Parties: mean both the Licensee and the Licensor.

These expressions may be used both in singular and plural form.


Article 2 - PURPOSE
-------------------


The purpose of the  Agreement  is  to  enable  the  Licensor  to  grant  the
Licensee a free, non-exclusive, transferable and worldwide License  for  the
Software as set forth in  Article  5  hereinafter  for  the  whole  term  of
protection of the rights over said Software.


Article 3 - ACCEPTANCE

for the presence of any or all faults to be detected. In this  respect,  the
Licensee's attention has been drawn to the risks  associated  with  loading,
using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing  the  Software  that  are
reserved for experienced users.

The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or  all  means,  the
product's suitability for its requirements, its due and proper  functioning,
and for ensuring that it  shall  not  cause  damage  to  either  persons  or
property.

grant all the rights on the  Software (including in  particular  the  rights
set forth in Article 5 hereof over the Software).

Licensor without any or all other express  or  tacit  warranty,  other  than
that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in  particular,  without  any  or  all
warranty as to its market  value,  its  secured,  innovative  or  relevant
nature.

Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is  free  from
any or all error, that it shall  operate  continuously,  that  it  shall  be
compatible  with   the   Licensee's   own   equipment   and   its   software
configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee's requirements.

Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against  any  or
all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in  respect  of  the
use, modification and redistribution of the Software.  Nevertheless,  should
such proceedings be instituted against  the  Licensee,  the  Licensor  shall
provide it with  technical  and  legal  assistance  for  its  defense.  Such
technical and legal assistance shall  be  decided  upon  on  a  case-by-case
basis  between  the  relevant  Licensor  and  the  Licensee  pursuant  to  a
memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability  as

shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in  compliance  with
the terms and conditions hereof.


Article 11  - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

whether written or oral, between the Parties and having  the  same  purpose,

conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the  Parties  unless  it  is
made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.

conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative  text,  said
act or legislative text shall take precedence, and the  Parties  shall  make

legislative  text.  All  the  other  provisions  shall   remain   effective.

void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement  as  a  whole
