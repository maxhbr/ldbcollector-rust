You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,\ndirectly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Nokia and including the\nname of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version\nor related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered\nSoftware.\n\n3.4  Intellectual Property Matters\n\n(a) Third Party Claims.\n\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual\nproperty rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under\nSections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\ndistribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim\nin sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia\nor any Contributor.
