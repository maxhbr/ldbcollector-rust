Therefore,\nthe Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee\narising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be\ninstituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the\nSoftware. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against\nthe Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal\nassistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be\ndecided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the\nLicensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding.
