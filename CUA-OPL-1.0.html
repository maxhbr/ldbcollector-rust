Availability of Source Code.\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\nmade available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\neither on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\nExecutable version available; and if made available via Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\nmonths after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\nhas been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\nensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\nfile documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\nthe date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\nthe Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\nCode provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\nInitial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\nExecutable version or related documentation in which You describe the\norigin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n\n(a) Third Party Claims.\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\nintellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\ngranted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\nContributor must include a text file with the Source Code\ndistribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\nparty making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\nknow whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\nthe Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\nContributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\nContributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\nreasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\nCode that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n(b) Contributor APIs.\n\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\ninterface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\nare reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\nalso include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n(c) Representations.\n\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\nSection 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\nModifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\nContributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\nthis License.\n\n3.5. Required Notices.\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\nCode. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\nCode file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\nlocation (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\nto look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)\nYou may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\nExhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\nfor the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\nrights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to\ncharge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\nobligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\nmay do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\nDeveloper or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\nany such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\noffered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\nDeveloper and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\nInitial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\nrequirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\nand if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\nthe Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\nincluding a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\nobligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\nin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\ncollateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\nCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\nCode or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\ncontain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\ncompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\nExecutable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\nrights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\nLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\nlicense You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\nfrom this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\nDeveloper or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\nInitial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\nthe Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\nterms You offer.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\nnot governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\nWork as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\nrequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect.

You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\nof any subsequent version of the License published by CUA Office Project. No one\nother than CUA Office Project has the right to modify the terms applicable to\nCovered Code created under this License.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\nonly do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\ngoverned by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\nthe phrases \"CUA Office\", \"CUA\", \"CUAPL\", or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\nlicense (except to note that your license differs from this License)\nand (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\ncontains terms which differ from the CUA Office Public License.

If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\nalleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\nlicense.\n\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\nall end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\nwhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\nOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
