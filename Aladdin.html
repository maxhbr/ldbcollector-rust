(Version 8, November 18, 1999)

Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999 Aladdin Enterprises,
Menlo Park, California, U.S.A. All rights reserved.

NOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses published by the
Free Software Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from those of
the GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this
license with extra care.

Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply this License
to their own work, as long as the entire License (including the above notices
and this paragraph) is copied with no changes, additions, or deletions except
for changing the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description
of the work to which the license is being applied and of the person or entity
that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being applied to a
work created in a country other than the United States, replacing the first
paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the laws of the
appropriate country.

0. Subject Matter 
This License applies to the computer program known as "Aladdin Ghostscript." The
"Program", below, refers to such program. The Program is a copyrighted work
whose copyright is held by Aladdin Enterprises (the "Licensor"). Please note
that Aladdin Ghostscript is neither the program known as "GNU Ghostscript" nor
the version of Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from Artifex
Software Inc.

A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work of
the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such as a
translation or a modification.

BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM), YOU
INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND
CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON
IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR
DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY
LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR
DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.

1. Licenses.
Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply with
all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further, that
you distribute an unmodified copy of this License with the Program:

(a)
You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium.

(b)
You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and distribute
copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.


2. Restrictions.
This license is subject to the following restrictions:

(a)
Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a commercial
organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is made in
connection with such distribution, whether directly (as in payment for a copy of
the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the
Program, or payment for some product or service that includes a copy of the
Program "without charge"; these are only examples, and not an exhaustive
enumeration of prohibited activities). The following methods of distribution
involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this
restriction:

(i)
Posting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval service
for which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line
service), provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be
the same for retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random
data) and that access to the service and to the Program is available independent
of any other product or service. An example of a service that does not fall
under this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company and that
is only available to customers of that company. (This is not an exhaustive
enumeration.)

(ii)
Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media, provided that the
files containing the Program are reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media,
that all information on such media be redistributable for non-commercial
purposes without charge, and that such media are distributed by themselves
(except for accompanying documentation) independent of any other product or
service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical
storage media. (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a
distribution that does not fall under this section is a CD-ROM included in a
book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)

(b)
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the Program are
not subject to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional use
(running) of the Program is not restricted, and any output produced through the
use of the Program is subject to this license only if its contents constitute a
work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program).

(c)
You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work that you
distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof ("the Work"):

(i)
If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry prominent
notices stating that you have modified the Program's files and the date of any
change. In each source file that you have modified, you must include a prominent
notice that you have modified the file, including your name, your e-mail address
(if any), and the date and purpose of the change;

(ii)
You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License;

(iii)
If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it,
at each time the Work commences operation, to print or display an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty
(or else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice must also state that
users may redistribute the Work only under the conditions of this License and
tell the user how to view the copy of this License included with the Work.
(Exceptions: if the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays such
an announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an "About box", the
Work is required to print or display the notice only under the same
circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
such an announcement, the Work is not required to print an announcement.);

(iv)
You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable code. If you distribute with the Work any component that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
runs, you must also distribute the source code of that component if you have it
and are allowed to do so;

(v)
If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work, such
material must include either a written copy of this License, or a prominent
written indication that the Work is covered by this License and written
instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of the License on the
distribution medium;

(vi)
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise of the
rights granted herein.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the equivalent
ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability to
copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source code along
with the object code.

3. Reservation of Rights.
No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein. You
may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense
or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

4. Other Restrictions.
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries
for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

5. Limitations.
THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6. General.

This License is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A.,
excluding choice of law rules.

If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that part
shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law, and no
other parts of the License shall be affected.

For United States Government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED
RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States Government or are
acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency, the following apply:

If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense ("DOD"), the Program and its
documentation are classified as "commercial computer software" and "commercial
computer software documentation" respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section
227.7202, the Government is acquiring the Program and its documentation in
accordance with the terms of this License. If the unit or agency is other than
DOD, the Program and its documentation are classified as "commercial computer
software" and "commercial computer software documentation" respectively and,
pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is acquiring the Program and its
documentation in accordance with the terms of this License.</pre><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>&larr;[AppliesTo] Copyleft</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(31)"></div><p>Copyleft</p><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/">SPDX</a></li><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li><li><a href="https://blueoakcouncil.org/">Blue Oak Council</a></li></ul><div></div></div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>&larr;[AppliesTo] $JSON</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(94)"></div><pre>Array [
