BY CLICKING THE "I AGREE" BUTTON OR BY USING ANY PART OF THE TIZEN SDK, YOU AGREE (ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND/OR YOUR COMPANY) TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH THEN COMMENCES WITH EFFECT AS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND SAMSUNG. IF YOU DO NOT OR CANNOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THE TIZEN SDK.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This license is primarily applicable to several proprietary components, which are not open sourced. If applicable, the Open Source Software license shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such Open Source Software.

1. Definitions.

1.1 "Affiliate" means an entity that, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party to this Agreement, but only for so long as such control exists, and where "control" shall mean ownership of more than 50% of the stock or other equity interests entitled to vote for the election of directors or an equivalent governing body.

1.2 "Open Source Software" includes, without limitation, a software license that requires as a condition of use, modification, and/or distribution of such software that such software or other software incorporated into, derived from or distributed with such software be (a) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (b) be licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (c) be redistributable at no charge.

1.3 "Tizen SDK" includes the documentation, software, both source code and object code, sample applications, emulator, tools, libraries, APIs, data, and materials provided by Samsung to You for use in connection with Your application development, and includes any updates that may be provided by Samsung.

1.4 "Tizen Certified Platform" shall mean a software platform that complies with the standards set forth in the Tizen Compliance Specification and passes the Tizen Compliance Tests as defined from time to time by the Tizen Technical Steering Group and certified by the Tizen Association or its designated agent.

1.5 "Tizen Applications" means all applications that are developed by using the Tizen SDK with or without extensions and can run only on the Tizen Certified Platform.

1.6 "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

2. License Grant.

2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Samsung hereby grants to You a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable and worldwide license to use for the sole purpose of the development of Tizen Applications.

3. Restrictions.

3.1 Except for the limited license granted to You herein, You agree that all right, title and interest in and to the  Tizen SDK including the concepts and technology inherent in them, Samsung or Tizen trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, are, and at all times shall remain, the sole and exclusive property of Samsung. Except to the extent permitted under this Agreement or by applicable law, You shall not (i) modify, reverse engineer or disassemble any portion of the Tizen SDK; (ii) lease, rent, copy, redistribute or sublicense the Tizen SDK to third party; or (iii) remove, efface or obscure any copyright notices, logos or other proprietary notices or legends included in the Tizen SDK. You may not use any component part of the Tizen SDK in any way independent from the Tizen SDK. You may not load or install any of the Tizen SDK onto mobile phones or any other devices, except a personal computer.

3.2 Samsung may extend, enhance, or otherwise modify the Tizen SDK at any time without notice. If updates are made available by Samsung, the terms of this Agreement will govern such updates, unless the update is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. Samsung is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the Tizen SDK. You acknowledge that Samsung has no express or implied obligation to announce or make available any updates to the Tizen SDK.

4. Use of the Tizen SDK. 

4.1 Your Applications must not (i) breach any applicable laws, regulations or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the applicable jurisdictions; (ii) contain any material, component or code which could damage, destroy, unduly burden or unreasonably affect software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, services, or networks; or (iii) disable, hack or otherwise interfere with any authentication, content protection, digital signing, digital rights management, security or verification mechanisms implemented in or by the Tizen Certified platform.

4.2 Your Applications must not breach any applicable laws, regulations or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the applicable jurisdictions or disable, unduly burden or unreasonably interfere with software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, services, or networks. 

4.3 You agree that You are solely liable for any breach of your obligations under this Agreement or any applicable laws or regulations, and for the consequences of any such breach.

5. Open Source Software.

5.1 You hereby acknowledge that the Tizen SDK may contain Open Source Software.

To the extent any such license requires that Samsung provides Developer the rights to copy, modify, distribute or otherwise use any Open Source Software that are inconsistent with the limited rights granted to You in this Agreement, then such rights in the applicable Open Source Software license shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such Open Source Software. 

5.2 You acknowledge that the Open Source Software license is solely between You and the applicable Open Source Software. You shall comply with the terms of all applicable Open Source Software licenses, if any.
