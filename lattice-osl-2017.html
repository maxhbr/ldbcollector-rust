This is a legal agreement between You (Licensee, either a company or an individual), and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation if You are located in the United States or Lattice SG Pte. Ltd. if You are located in a country other than the United States. Lattice Semiconductor Corporation or Lattice SG Pte. Ltd. is the Provider (Licensor) of the Software.  If a component covered by this Agreement can be included in the output files generated by the Provider’s LatticeMico System or any other Provider source code generation tool, then Software refers to such output files that includes that component.  Otherwise, Software refers to the component on a standalone basis.  By proceeding with the installation, modification, use or distribution in whole or in part of Software that identifies itself as licensed under the Lattice Open Source License Agreement, You agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
