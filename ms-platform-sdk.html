END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR MICROSOFT SOFTWARE
MICROSOFT PLATFORM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT

IMPORTANT—READ CAREFULLY: This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Microsoft Corporation for the Microsoft software that accompanies this EULA, which includes computer software and may include associated media, printed materials, "online" or electronic documentation, and Internet-based services ("Software"). An amendment or addendum to this EULA may accompany the Software. YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY, OR USE THE SOFTWARE; YOU MAY RETURN IT TO YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE FOR A FULL REFUND, IF APPLICABLE.

1.	GRANT OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants you the rights described in this EULA provided that you comply with all terms and conditions of this EULA.

1.1	General License Grant. Microsoft grants you a limited, nonexclusive license to use the Software, and to make and use copies of the Software, for the purposes of designing, developing and testing your software applications for use with any version or edition of a Microsoft Windows operating system for personal computers or servers ("Microsoft Operating System Product").

1.2	Sharepoint Portal Server SDK. The Software contains the SharePoint Portal Server Software Development Kit ("SPSSDK"). In addition to the license granted in Section 1.1, Microsoft grants you a limited, nonexclusive license to modify the sample source code located in the SPSSDK solely to design, develop, and test your application internally within your organization. Your entire license under this EULA with respect to the SPSSDK is conditioned on your not using the SPSSDK to create software that is incompatible with file formats indexed by Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server 2001.

2.	ADDITIONAL LICENSE RIGHTS—REDISTRIBUTABLE COMPONENTS

2.1	Source Code. "Source Code" means source code that is located in any directory or sub-directory named "samples" in the Software or that is otherwise identified as sample code in the Software, other than source code included in the SPSSDK, or is identified as Microsoft Foundation Class Libraries ("MFC"), Template Libraries ("ATL"), and C runtimes (CRTs). Microsoft grants you a limited, nonexclusive license (a) to use and modify any Source Code to design, develop, and test your software applications; and (b) to make and distribute copies of the Source Code and your modifications, subject to your compliance with Section 3.

2.2	Redistributable Code. All portions of the Software that are listed in the text file \License\Redist.txt collectively constitute "Redistributable Code." Microsoft grants you a limited, nonexclusive license to reproduce and distribute Redistributable Code in object code form only, subject to your compliance with Section 3.

3.	DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS AND LICENSE LIMITATIONS

3.1	Your licenses under Section 2 to distribute Source Code, any modifications you make to the Source Code under Section 2.1, and Redistributable Code (collectively, "Redistributables") are conditioned on the following: (a) you will distribute Redistributables only in object code form and in conjunction with and as a part of a software application developed by you that adds significant and primary functionality to the Redistributables ("Application"); 
(b) the Redistributables will operate only in conjunction with a Microsoft Operating System Product; 
(c) your Application will invoke the Software only via interfaces described in the documentation accompanying the Software; 
(d) you will distribute your Application containing the Redistributables only pursuant to an end-user license agreement (which may be break-the-seal, click- wrap or signed) with terms no less protective than those contained in this EULA; 
(e) you will not use Microsoft’s name, logo, or trademarks to market your Application; 
(f) you will include a valid copyright notice on your Application sufficient to protect Microsoft’s copyright in the Software; 
(g) you will not remove or obscure any copyright, trademark or patent notices that appear on or in the Software as delivered to you; 
(h) you will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Microsoft from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of your Application; and 
(i) you will otherwise comply with the terms of this EULA.  You may not permit further distribution of Redistributables by your end users except that you may permit further redistribution of Redistributables by your distributors to end users if your distributors only distribute the Redistributables in conjunction with and as part of your Application or Applications, you comply with all other terms of this EULA, and your distributors comply with all restrictions of this EULA that are applicable to you.

3.2	Renaming MFC, ATL or CRTs. You must rename all files containing MFC, ATL or CRTs prior to distributing them or any modifications to them.

3.3	Linking .lib Files. For any Redistributable Code having a filename extension of .lib, you may distribute only the results of running such Redistributable Code through a linker with your application.

3.4	Notice for Windows Media Technologies. In each Application in which you include any Redistributables from the Windows Media Player SDK, Windows Media Services SDK, Windows Media Encoder SDK, or Windows Media Software Development Kit (including but not limited to, the Windows Media Format SDK) portions of the Software, you must include in your Application’s Help-About box (or if there is no such box, then in another location that end users will easily discover), a copyright notice stating the following: "Portions utilize Microsoft Windows Media Technologies. Copyright (c) 1999-2002 Microsoft Corporation. All Rights Reserved."

3.5	No Alteration to Setup Programs. If any Redistributables in the Software as delivered to you are contained in a separate setup program, then you may only
distribute those Redistributables as part of that setup program, without alteration to that setup program or removal of any of its components.

3.6	Prerelease Code. The Software may contain prerelease code that might not operate correctly, is not at the level of performance and compatibility of the final, generally available product offering, and might be substantially modified prior to shipment of that offering. Microsoft is not obligated to make this or any later version of the Software commercially available. Your license under Section 2 to distribute any Redistributables identified in the documentation as prerelease, alpha, beta or release candidate code or under a similar designation indicating code that is not intended for commercial distribution (collectively, "Prerelease Code") is conditioned upon your marking the version of your Application containing the Prerelease Code as "BETA," "PRE-RELEASE" or other reasonable designation of similar import. Your license under this Section 3.3 terminates upon Microsoft’s publicly announced commencement of the commercial availability of the Microsoft Operating System Product for which your Application is developed.

3.7	Identified Software. If you use the Redistributables, then in addition to your compliance with the applicable distribution requirements described for the Redistributables, the following also applies. Your license rights to Redistributables are conditioned on your (a) not incorporating Identified Software into or combining Identified Software with the Redistributables; (b) not distributing Identified Software in conjunction with the Redistributables; and (c) not using Identified Software in the development of a derivative work of Source Code. "Identified Software" means software that is licensed pursuant to terms that directly or indirectly create, or purport to create, obligations for Microsoft with respect to the Redistributables or grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights or immunities under Microsoft’s intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Redistributables. Identified Software includes, without limitation, any software that requires as a condition of its use, modification and/or distribution that any other software incorporated into, derived from or distributed with such software must also be disclosed or distributed in source code form, licensed for the purpose of making derivative works, or redistributable at no charge.

4.	COMPONENT EULAS. As a kit of development tools and other Microsoft software programs (each such tool or software program, a "Component"), the Software may contain one or more Components for which a separate end-user license agreement (a "Component EULA") may appear upon installation of the applicable Component.
