License.\n\n1.1 Grant\n\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-\nexclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense (except as\nexpressly provided in this Agreement) to:\n\n    (i) Install and use the SDK,\n\n    (ii) Modify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in\n    the SDK, and\n\n    (iii) Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified in this\n    Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in object code format into a\n    software application that meets the distribution requirements indicated in\n    this Agreement.\n\n1.2 Distribution Requirements\n\nThese are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution grant:\n\n    (i) Your application must have material additional functionality, beyond the\n    included portions of the SDK.\n\n    (ii) The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be accessed by your\n    application.\n\n    (iii) The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative\n    works of sample source code distributed: “This software contains source code\n    provided by NVIDIA Corporation.”\n\n    (iv) Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement as\n    distributable, it is delivered for your internal use only.\n\n    (v) The terms under which you distribute your application must be consistent\n    with the terms of this Agreement, including (without limitation) terms\n    relating to the license grant and license restrictions and protection of\n    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you agree that you will\n    protect the privacy, security and legal rights of your application users.\n\n    (vi) You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected\n    distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance with the requirements of\n    this Agreement, and to enforce the terms of your agreements with respect to\n    distributed SDK.\n\n1.3 Authorized Users\n\nYou may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your\nsubsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your secure network to perform\nwork on your behalf.\n\nIf you are an academic institution you may allow users enrolled or employed by\nthe academic institution to access and use the SDK from your secure network.\n\nYou are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your\nauthorized users. If you become aware that your authorized users didn’t follow\nthe terms of this Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the\nnon-compliance and prevent new occurrences.\n\n1.4 Pre-Release SDK\n\nThe SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as pre-release,\nmay not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have\nreduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and\nreliability standards relative to commercial versions of NVIDIA software and\nmaterials. Use of a pre-release SDK may result in unexpected results, loss of\ndata, project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss.\n\nYou may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that pre-release\nSDKs are not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.\n\nNVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release\nSDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate the\navailability of a pre-release SDK at any time without liability.\n\n1.5 Updates\n\nNVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates\nto this SDK.
