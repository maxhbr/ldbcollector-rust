    "GNU EMACS GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t\t    (Clarified 11 Feb 1988)\n\n Copyright (C) 1985, 1987, 1988 Richard M. Stallman\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also\n use this wording to make the terms for other programs.\n\n  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the\nmercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is\nintended to give everyone the right to share GNU Emacs.  To make\nsure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make\nrestrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you\nto surrender the rights.  Hence this license agreement.\n\n  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give\naway copies of Emacs, that you receive source code or else can get it\nif you want it, that you can change Emacs or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to\ndeprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute\ncopies of Emacs, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone\nfinds out that there is no warranty for GNU Emacs.  If Emacs is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know\nthat what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems\nintroduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.\n\n  Therefore we (Richard Stallman and the Free Software Fundation,\nInc.) make the following terms which say what you must do to be\nallowed to distribute or change GNU Emacs.\n\n\t\t\tCOPYING POLICIES\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of GNU Emacs source code\nas you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice \"Copyright\n(C) 1988 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\" (or with whatever year is\nappropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this\nLicense Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients of the GNU Emacs program a copy of this License\nAgreement along with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee\nfor the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of GNU Emacs source code or\nany portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under\nthe terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,\n    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of GNU Emacs\n    or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third\n    parties on terms identical to those contained in this License\n    Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive\n    warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\n    c) if the modified program serves as a text editor, cause it when\n    started running in the simplest and usual way, to print an\n    announcement including a valid copyright notice \"Copyright (C)\n    1988 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\" (or with the year that is\n    appropriate), saying that there is no warranty (or else, saying\n    that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the\n    program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a\n    copy of this License Agreement.\n\n    d) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of\n    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty\n    protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other program under the scope of these terms.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute GNU Emacs (or a portion or derivative of it,\nunder Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal\n    shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nFor an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for\nall modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include\nsource code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the\noperating system on which the executable file runs.\n\n  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer GNU Emacs\nexcept as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer GNU Emacs is void and\nyour rights to use GNU Emacs under this License agreement shall be\nautomatically terminated.  However, parties who have received computer\nsoftware programs from you with this License Agreement will not have\ntheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. If you wish to incorporate parts of GNU Emacs into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the Free Software\nFoundation.  We have not yet worked out a simple rule that can be stated\nhere, but we will often permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of\npreserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of\npromoting the sharing and reuse of software.\n\nYour comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our\nsoftware are welcome!  Please contact the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, or call (617) 876-3296.\n\n\t\t\t   NO WARRANTY\n\n  BECAUSE GNU EMACS IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY\nNO WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT\nWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC,\nRICHARD M. STALLMAN AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE GNU EMACS \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\nBUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY\nAND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE GNU EMACS\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY\nSERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL FREE SOFTWARE\nFOUNDATION, INC., RICHARD M. STALLMAN, AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\nMODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE GNU EMACS AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH PROGRAMS NOT DISTRIBUTED BY\nFREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC.) THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY\nOTHER PARTY.",
