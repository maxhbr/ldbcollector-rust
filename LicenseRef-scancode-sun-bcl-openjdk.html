You may have others,\nwhich vary from state to state.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nUNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,\nREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE\nDISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE\nLEGALLY INVALID.\n\n8.

In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract,\ntort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you\nSoftware under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if\nthe above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.
