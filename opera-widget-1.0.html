© Copyright 2006 Opera Software ASA.  All rights reserved. 

OPERA SOFTWARE ASA (OPERA)  IS WILLING TO PERMIT USE OF THIS SOFTWARE BY 
YOU, ONLY UPON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED 
IN THIS DOCUMENT.  PLEASE READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT 
CAREFULLY.  IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BE BOUND, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO 
ACCESS THE CONTENTS OF, STUDY OR MAKE USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN ANY WAY.  


Terms of Agreement


1. Definitions
	a) "Original Code" means:
The original version of the program accompanying this Agreement as 
released by Opera Software ASA ("OPERA") , including source code, object 
code and documentation, if any.  
	b) "Covered Code" means:
The Original Source Code, Contributions, the combination of the Original 
Code and Contributions, and/or any respective portions thereof.  
	c) "Contribution" means:
in the case of OPERA, the Original Code, and
in the case of each Contributor, changes to the Original code, and 
additions to the Original Code; where such changes and/or additions to 
the Original Code originate from and are distributed by that particular 
Contributor.  A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was 
added to the Original Code by such Contributor itself or anyone acting 
on such Contributor's behalf.  
Contributions do not include additions to the Original Code which: (i)  
are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the 
Original Code under their own license agreement, and (ii)  are not 
derivative works of the Original Code.  
	d) "Contributor" means:
OPERA and any other entity that distributes the Covered Code.  
	e) "Recipient" means:
Anyone who receives the Covered Code under this Agreement, including all 
Contributors.  
	f) "Larger Work" means:
A work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not 
governed by the terms of this Agreement, specifically additions to the 
Original Code which: (i)  are separate modules of software distributed in 
conjunction with the Original Code under their own license agreement, 
and (ii)  are not derivative works of the Original Code.  


2. Grant of Rights
	a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to 
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly 
perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, 
if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.  
The limited license granted in this Section is only for the integration 
of the Contribution with or for the use of the Contribution in 
connection with other proprietary software of OPERA, including but not 
limited to OPERA’s browser software.  
	b) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
provided by any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the 
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.  Each 
Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by 
any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights 
or otherwise.  As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to 
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.  
	c) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
license set forth in this Agreement.  


3. Requirements
	a) A Contributor may choose to distribute the Larger Work under its own 
license agreement, provided that: 
		i. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; 
		ii. and its license agreement: 
			1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of 
title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of 
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 
			2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for 
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
consequential damages, such as lost profits; 
			3. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; 
			4. states that the Contribution only may be integrated with or used with 
other proprietary software of OPERA, including but not limited to 
OPERA’s browser software.  
			5. and states that source code for the Covered Code is available from 
such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.  
	b) When the Covered Code is made available: 
		i. it must be made available under this Agreement; and a copy of this 
Agreement must be included with each copy of the Covered Code.  
		ii. Each Contributor must duplicate, to the extent it does not already 
exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Covered Code of all 
Contributions, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
stating that the contributor changed the files and the date of any 
change.  
		iii. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator 
of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows 
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.  


4. No Warranty 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE COVERED CODE IS 
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  Each Recipient is solely responsible 
for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the 
Covered Code for commercial and non-commercial purposes and assumes all 
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, 
including but not limited to the risks and costs of Covered Code errors, 
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, code or 
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.


5. Disclaimer of Liability 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR 
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING 
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS) , HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)  ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE COVERED CODE OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED 
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  


6.  General 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action 
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.  

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails 
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement 
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after 
becoming aware of such noncompliance.  If all Recipient's rights under 
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution 
of the Covered Code as soon as reasonably practicable.  However, 
Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by 
Recipient relating to the Covered Code shall continue and survive.  

OPERA may publish new versions (including revisions)  of this Agreement 
from time to time.  Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
distinguishing version number.  The Covered Code (including 
Contributions)  may always be distributed subject to the version of the 
Agreement under which it was received.  In addition, after a new version 
of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the 
Covered Code (including its Contributions)  under the new version.  No one 
other than OPERA has the right to modify this Agreement.  Except as 
expressly stated in Section 2(a) , Recipient receives no rights or 
licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this 
Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.  All 
rights in the Covered Code not expressly granted under this Agreement 
are reserved.  

This Agreement is governed by the laws of Norway.  Any and all disputes 
arising out of the rights and obligations in this Agreement shall be 
submitted to ordinary court proceedings.  You accept the Oslo City Court 
as legal venue under this Agreement.</pre><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>&larr;[AppliesTo] Proprietary Free</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(1563)"></div><p>Proprietary Free</p><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div></div></div><h2>forward</h2><div class="tree"><h3>opera-widget-1.0</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(7188)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div><div class="tree"><h3>Opera Widget License v1.0 [Same]&rarr;</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(7187)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>Opera Widget License 1.0 [Same]&rarr;</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(7186)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>LicenseRef-scancode-opera-widget-1.0 [Same]&rarr;</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(7185)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div></div></div><h2>dot</h2><pre>digraph {
