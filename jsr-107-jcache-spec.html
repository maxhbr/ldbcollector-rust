Specification Leads hereby grant you a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited license (without the right to sublicense), under Specification Leads' applicable intellectual property rights to view, download, use and reproduce the Specification only for the purpose of internal evaluation. This includes (i) developing applications intended to run on an implementation of the Specification, provided that such applications do not themselves implement any portion(s) of the Specification, and (ii) discussing the Specification with any third party; and (iii) excerpting brief portions of the Specification in oral or written communications which discuss the Specification provided that such excerpts do not in the aggregate constitute a significant portion of the Specification.

2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations. Specification Leads also grant you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to sublicense) under any applicable copyrights or, subject to the provisions of subsection 4 below, patent rights it may have covering the Specification to create and/or distribute an Independent Implementation of the Specification that: (a) fully implements the Specification including all its required interfaces and functionality; (b) does not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within the Licensor Name Space other than those required/authorized by the Specification or Specifications being implemented; and (c) passes the Technology Compatibility Kit (including satisfying the requirements of the applicable TCK Users Guide) for such Specification ("Compliant Implementation").

4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses.

a. With respect to any patent claims covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2 above that would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations of the Specification, such license is conditioned upon your offering on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from You, a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license under Your patent rights which are or would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations of the Specification to develop, distribute and use a Compliant Implementation.

b With respect to any patent claims owned by Specification Leads and covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2, whether or not their infringement can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when implementing the Specification, such license shall terminate with respect to such claims if You initiate a claim against Specification Leads that it has, in the course of performing its responsibilities as the Specification Leads, induced any other entity to infringe Your patent rights.

c Also with respect to any patent claims owned by Specification Leads and covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2 above, where the infringement of such claims can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when implementing the Specification such license, with respect to such claims, shall terminate if You initiate a claim against Specification Leads that its making, having made, using, offering to sell, selling or importing a Compliant Implementation infringes Your patent rights.

5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement: "Independent Implementation" shall mean an implementation of the Specification that neither derives from any of Specification Leads' source code or binary code materials nor, except with an appropriate and separate license from Specification Leads, includes any of Specification Leads' source code or binary code materials; "Licensor Name Space" shall mean the public class or interface declarations whose names begin with "java", "javax", "com.oracle", "com.sun" or their equivalents in any subsequent naming convention adopted by Oracle America, Inc. through the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or replacements thereof; and "Technology Compatibility Kit" or "TCK" shall mean the test suite and accompanying TCK User's Guide provided by Specification Leads which corresponds to the Specification and that was available either (i) from Specification Leads' 120 days before the first release of Your Independent Implementation that allows its use for commercial purposes, or (ii) more recently than 120 days from such release but against which You elect to test Your implementation of the Specification.

This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Specification Leads if you breach the Agreement or act outside the scope of the licenses granted above.
