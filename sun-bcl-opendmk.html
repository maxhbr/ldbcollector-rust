writing to Sun. Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of
the Agreement.

liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace

BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF
THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY
TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract,
tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you
Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if
the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not
allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the
terms above may not be applicable to you.

9. Export Regulations.

under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be
subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree to
comply strictly with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that you

U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the
Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation will be only
as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201
through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with
48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

11. Governing Law.

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law and
controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction
will apply.

12. Severability.

Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless omission
would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will
immediately terminate.

13. Integration.

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its
subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over
any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or
other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during
the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will be binding,
unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party.
