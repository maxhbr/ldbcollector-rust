 #	Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its

 #	NO WARRANTY
 #	
 #	The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the

 #	any right of any third party.
 #	
 #	Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to

 #	the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
 #	otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
 #	
 #	Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other

 #	with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
 #	or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,

 #	knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the

 #	foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
 #	"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
 #	modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
 #	production of secondary products from the program.
 #	
 #	In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
 #	modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
 #	any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
 #	grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in

5. Time Zone Database
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.
7.  Database Ownership

   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public
   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply
   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.
   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,
   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in
   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,
   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court
   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust
   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the
   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
   contribution or in the TZ Database.</pre><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>&larr;[AppliesTo] Permissive</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(1540)"></div><p>Permissive</p><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li><li><a href="https://blueoakcouncil.org/">Blue Oak Council</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/HansHammel/license-compatibility-checker">HansHammel license compatibility checker</a></li></ul><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><h2>forward</h2><div class="tree"><h3>LicenseRef-scancode-ibm-icu</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(4770)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><h2>dot</h2><pre>digraph {
