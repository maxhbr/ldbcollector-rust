You may distribute the Executable \nversion of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms \ndifferent from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this \nLicense and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or \nalter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this \nLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must \nmake it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by \nYou alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to \nindemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the \nInitial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you \ndistribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the \nnotice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the \nproduct.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not \ngoverned by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single \nproduct. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are \nfulfilled for the Covered Code. \n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect \nto some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) \ncomply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite \nall of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this \nlicense. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must \nbe included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all \ndistributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or \nregulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary \nskill to be able to understand it. \n\n5. Application of this License.\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in \nExhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n6.1. New Versions.\nLicense Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to \ntime. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be \nsubmitted to opensource.org for certification.\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, \nYou may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also \nchoose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the \nLicense published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the \nright to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\nIf you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the \nrequired Devloper Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do \nin order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this \nLicense), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"Open\", \"OpenPL\", \n\"OPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and \n(b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ \nfrom the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original \nCode or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be \ndeemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\nThis license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in \nthe same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:\n\n[1] A Developer specific license.\n\n[2] The contents of this file OPL.html, stating the general licensing policy of \nthe software.\n\nIn case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-\nnumbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. \nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, \nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, \nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE \nIS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE \nOR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND \nPERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY \nCOVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE \nINITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF \nANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER \nOF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO \nUSE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER \nTHIS DISCLAIMER. \n\n8. TERMINATION. \n8.1 Termination upon Breach\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail \nto comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming \naware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly \ngranted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, \nmust remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \n8.2. Termination Upon Litigation.\nIf You initiate litigation by asserting a patent \ninfringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or \na Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action \nis referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any \npatent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under \nSections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from \nParticipant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of \nnotice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable \nreasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by \nsuch Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the \nContributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a \nreasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon \nin writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights \ngranted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically \nterminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's \nContributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights \ngranted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are \nrevoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or \nhad made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such \nParticipant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such \nclaim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent \ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such \nParticipant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the \namount or value of any payment or license.\n\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license \nagreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by \nYou or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n9.

    "OpenContent License (OPL)\nVersion 1.0, July 14. 1998\n\nThis document outlines the principles underlying the OpenContent (OC) movement and may be redistributed provided it remains unaltered. For legal purposes, this document is the license under which OpenContent is made available for use.\n\nThe original version of this document may be found at http://www.opencontent.org/opl.html\n\nLICENSE\n\nTerms and Conditions for Copying, Distributing, and Modifying\n\nItems other than copying, distributing, and modifying the Content with which this license was distributed (such as using, etc.) are outside the scope of this license.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute exact replicas of the OpenContent (OC) as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the OC a copy of this License along with the OC. You may at your option charge a fee for the media and/or handling involved in creating a unique copy of the OC for use offline, you may at your option offer instructional support for the OC in exchange for a fee, or you may at your option offer warranty in exchange for a fee. You may not charge a fee for the OC itself. You may not charge a fee for the sole service of providing access to and/or use of the OC via a network (e.g. the Internet), whether it be via the world wide web, FTP, or any other method.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the OpenContent or any portion of it, thus forming works based on the Content, and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified content to carry prominent notices stating that you changed it, the exact nature and content of the changes, and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the OC or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License, unless otherwise permitted under applicable Fair Use law.\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the OC, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the OC, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Exceptions are made to this requirement to release modified works free of charge under this license only in compliance with Fair Use law where applicable.\n\n3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, distribute or modify the OC. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by distributing or translating the OC, or by deriving works herefrom, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or translating the OC.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n4. BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC) IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE OC, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE OC \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK OF USE OF THE OC IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE OC PROVE FAULTY, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE UNACCEPTABLE YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MIRROR AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE OC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",
