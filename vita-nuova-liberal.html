TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,  IN\n      NO  EVENT  SHALL VITA NUOVA OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE\n      FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS WHATSOEVER INCLUDING  BUT  NOT\n      LIMITED  TO  DIRECT,  INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL\n      LOSS OR DAMAGE, AND LOSS OF BUSINESS  AND/OR  PROFITS,\n      LOSS  OF  USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS\n      INFORMATION OR DATA, OR ANY OTHER FINANCIAL LOSS ARIS-\n      ING  OUT  OF  THE  USE  OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE\n      LICENSED SOFTWARE AND/OR ANY ADAPTATIONS, EVEN IF VITA\n      NUOVA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAM-\n      AGES.  IN ANY CASE, VITA NUOVA'S  AND  ITS  SUPPLIERS'\n      ENTIRE  LIABILITY  UNDER THIS LICENCE SHALL BE LIMITED\n      TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU  FOR  THE  LICENSED\n      SOFTWARE.\n7.1.

The submission to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  English\n      Courts  does  not limit VITA NUOVA's right to take any\n      Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions, nor does\n      the  taking of Proceedings by VITA NUOVA in any one or\n      more jurisdictions preclude VITA NUOVA taking Proceed-\n      ings in another jurisdiction if and to the extent per-\n      mitted by applicable law.\n8.1.

A person who is not a party to this LICENCE shall have\n      no  rights  pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third\n      Parties) Act 1999 (the ``Act'') to enforce any term of\n      this  LICENCE provided that a person who is the lawful\n      successor to or permitted assignee of the rights of  a\n      party  is  considered  to  be a party to this LICENCE.\n      Any right or remedy of a third party which  exists  or\n      is available apart from the Act is not affected.\n8.4.  VITA NUOVA may from time to time and at its sole  dis-\n      cretion  publish  a revised and/or new version of this\n      LICENCE which shall then govern the licensing  of  all\n      copies  of  LICENSED  SOFTWARE  supplied by VITA NUOVA\n      after the posting of  such  revised  or  new  licence.\n      Should  YOU  have any questions regarding this LICENCE\n      or wish to contact VITA NUOVA for any reason visit our\n      web site at www.vitanuova.com for contact details.",
