    "GHOSTSCRIPT GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n            (Clarified 11 Feb 1988)\n\n Copyright (C) 1988 Richard M. Stallman\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\n license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also use this wording\n to make the terms for other programs.\n\n  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the\nmercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is\nintended to give everyone the right to share Ghostscript.  To make sure\nthat you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make\nrestrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you\nto surrender the rights.  Hence this license agreement.\n\n  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give\naway copies of Ghostscript, that you receive source code or else can get\nit if you want it, that you can change Ghostscript or use pieces of it\nin new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to\ndeprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute\ncopies of Ghostscript, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds\nout that there is no warranty for Ghostscript.  If Ghostscript is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know\nthat what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems\nintroduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.\n\n  Therefore we (Richard M. Stallman and the Free Software Foundation,\nInc.) make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed\nto distribute or change Ghostscript.\n\n\n            COPYING POLICIES\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of Ghostscript source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright and license\nnotice \"Copyright (C) 1989 Aladdin Enterprises.  All rights reserved.\nDistributed by Free Software Foundation, Inc.\" (or with whatever year is\nappropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this\nLicense Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Ghostscript program a copy of this License Agreement\nalong with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee for the\nphysical act of transferring a copy.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of Ghostscript or any portion of\nit, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of\nParagraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,\n    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of Ghostscript\n    or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third\n    parties on terms identical to those contained in this License\n    Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive\n    warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\n    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of\n    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty\n    protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other program under the scope of these terms.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute Ghostscript (or a portion or derivative\nof it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the\nterms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the\nfollowing:\n\n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal\n    shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nFor an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for\nall modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include\nsource code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the\noperating system on which the executable file runs.\n\n  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer Ghostscript\nexcept as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer Ghostscript is\nvoid and your rights to use the program under this License agreement\nshall be automatically terminated.  However, parties who have received\ncomputer software programs from you with this License Agreement will not\nhave their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\ncompliance.\n\n  5. If you wish to incorporate parts of Ghostscript into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation at 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139.  We have not\nyet worked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often\npermit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free\nstatus of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the\nsharing and reuse of software.\n\nYour comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our\nsoftware are welcome!  Please contact the Free Software Foundation,\nInc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, or call (617) 876-3296.\n\n               NO WARRANTY\n\n  BECAUSE GHOSTSCRIPT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY\nNO WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT\nWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC, RICHARD\nM. STALLMAN, ALADDIN ENTERPRISES, L. PETER DEUTSCH, AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE GHOSTSCRIPT \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\nEXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE\nENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF GHOSTSCRIPT IS WITH\nYOU.  SHOULD GHOSTSCRIPT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL RICHARD M.\nSTALLMAN, THE FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC., L. PETER DEUTSCH, ALADDIN\nENTERPRISES, AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE\nGHOSTSCRIPT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING\nANY LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE\nPROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS) GHOSTSCRIPT, EVEN IF YOU\nHAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM\nBY ANY OTHER PARTY.",
