confidential information and in no event shall use less than reasonable
care. The terms of this Confidentiality section shall survive

INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR FOR THE COST OF
PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY
RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED

OTHER LOSSES FOR LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR ANY AND ALL

OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED. IN NO EVENT WILL COUCHBASE
INC.'S OR ITS LICENSORS' AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO LICENSEE, FROM ALL
CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, EXCEED ONE
THOUSAND DOLLARS (US $1,000). The parties expressly acknowledge and
agree that Couchbase Inc. has set its prices and entered into this
Agreement in reliance upon the limitations of liability specified

form a basis of the bargain between the parties.

10. General. Couchbase Inc. shall not be liable for any delay or failure
in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control. Neither
party will, without the other party's prior written consent, make any
news release, public announcement, denial or confirmation of this
Agreement, its value, or its terms and conditions, or in any manner
advertise or publish the fact of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
above, Couchbase Inc. may use Licensee's name and logo, consistent with
Licensee's trademark policies, on customer lists so long as such use in
no way promotes either endorsement or approval of Couchbase Inc. or any
Couchbase Inc. products or services. Licensee may not assign this
Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise,
without Couchbase Inc.'s prior written consent. Any attempt to assign
this Agreement, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the
benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns. If for any
reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this
Agreement invalid or unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will
be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions
of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The failure by
either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not
constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other
provision. All waivers must be in writing and signed by both parties.
All notices permitted or required under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be delivered in person, by confirmed facsimile,
overnight courier service or mailed by first class, registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the party specified
above or such other address as either party may specify in writing. Such
notice shall be deemed to have been given upon receipt. This Agreement
shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A.,
excluding its conflicts of law rules. The parties expressly agree that
the UN Convention for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) will not
apply. Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will
be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the
Northern District of California and the parties hereby irrevocably
consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein. Any amendment or
modification to the Agreement must be in writing signed by both parties.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
or contemporaneous oral or written agreements regarding the subject
matter hereof. To the extent there is a conflict between this Agreement
and the terms of any "shrinkwrap" or "clickwrap" license included in any
package, media, or electronic version of Couchbase Inc.-furnished
software, the terms and conditions of this Agreement will control. Each
of the parties has caused this Agreement to be executed by its duly
authorized representatives as of the Effective Date. Except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its
remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other
remedies under this Agreement or otherwise. The parties to this
Agreement are independent contractors and this Agreement will not
establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment,
franchise, or agency between the parties. Neither party will have the
power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other's behalf
without the other's prior written consent.
