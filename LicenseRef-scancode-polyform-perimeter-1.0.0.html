## Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of

## Noncompete

Any purpose is a permitted purpose, except for providing to
others any product that competes with the software.

## Competition

If you use this software to market a product as a substitute
for the functionality or value of the software, it competes
with the software. A product may compete regardless how it is
designed or deployed. For example, a product may compete even

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
law. These terms do not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If

## Violations

violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
and take practical steps to correct past violations, within
32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
end immediately.

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable

or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***
