All other rights are expressly reserved by NVIDIA and its licensors.\n\n3. Redistribution; Physics Applications. Any redistribution of the APEX SDK (in\naccordance with Section 2 above) or portions thereof must be subject to an end user\nlicense agreement including language that\n(a) prohibits the end user from modifying, reproducing, de-compiling, reverse\nengineering or translating the APEX SDK;\n(b) prohibits the end user from distributing or transferring the APEX SDK other\nthan as part of the Physics Application;\n(c) disclaims any and all warranties on behalf of NVIDIA and its affiliated\ncompanies and licensors;\n(d) disclaims, to the maximum extent permitted by law, NVIDIA’s, its affiliated\ncompanies and its licensors' liability for all damages, direct or indirect, incidental or\nconsequential, that may arise from any use of the APEX SDK and/or Physics\nApplication;\n(e) requires the end user to agree not to export the APEX SDK and/or Physics\nApplication, directly or indirectly, in violation of any U.S. laws; and\n\nYOU ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY NVIDIA PRIOR TO USE OF THE APEX SDK\nIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY COMMERCIAL PHYSICS APPLICATION.\nPLEASE SEND NOTIFICATION BY EMAIL TO:\nPHYSXLICENSING@NVIDIA.COM AND PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING\nINFORMATION IN THE EMAIL:\n- COMPANY NAME\n- PUBLISHER NAME\n- GAME TITLE\n- PLATFORMS (I.E. PC, XBOX, PS3, WII)\n- SCHEDULED SHIP DATE\n\nANY COMMERCIAL PHYSICS APPLICATION INTEGRATING THE APEX SDK IS\nSUBJECT TO A LICENSE TO NVIDIA FOR USE AND PUBLIC DISPLAY OF\nSUCH PHYSICS APPLICATION FOR ADVERTISING AND MARKETING\nPURPOSES.\n\nFAILURE TO NOTIFY NVIDIA PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION AND FAILURE\nTO PROVIDE ATTRIBUTION PURSUANT TO SECTION 6 SHALL BE\nCONSIDERED A MATERIAL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n4. Ownership, Protections. The APEX SDK is owned by NVIDIA and NVIDIA\nlicensors, and is protected by United States copyright laws, international treaty\nprovisions, and other applicable laws.
