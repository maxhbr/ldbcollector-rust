However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions.

Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
