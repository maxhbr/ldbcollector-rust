*This Cryptographic Autonomy License (the "License") applies to any
Work whose owner has marked it with any of the following notices, or a
similar demonstration of intent:*

SPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0
Licensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0

*or*

SPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0-Combined-Work-Exception
Licensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0, with
Combined Work Exception

______________________________________________________________________

## 1. Purpose

This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the
software to which it applies (the "Work"), either as-is or in modified
form, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and
contributors to the software from liability.

This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third
parties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third
party receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this
License requires that You provide that third party all the permissions
and materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without
that third party having a loss of data or capability due to your
actions.

The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.

## 2. Receiving a License

In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The
rules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the
Licensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with
the Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.

### 2.1. Application

The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from
Licensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or
implementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of
the Work (a "Modified Work"). Unless specified, any reference to the
Work also applies to a Modified Work.

### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance

This License is automatically offered to every person and
organization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its
conditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this
License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by
Licensor.

### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies

Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this
License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License
and infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the
event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be
enforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any
jurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the
Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may
enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via
specific performance.

## 3. Permissions
### 3.1. Permissions Granted

Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the
limitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:

+ a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent
intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are
subject; and

+ b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to
license, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as
distributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted

The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section
3.1:

+ a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are
only infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by
Licensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor,
directly or indirectly, with any other component, including other
software or hardware.

+ b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service
marks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply
with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.

## 4. Conditions

If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the
Work, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed,
communicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate
third party (a "Recipient"), either via physical delivery or via a
network connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the
following conditions:

### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code

Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each
Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the
Source Code corresponding to the Work ("Access").

The "Source Code" of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for
making modifications, including any comments, configuration
information, documentation, help materials, installation instructions,
cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary
for the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and
to have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.

#### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code

Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You
or by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must
persist during the same period in which You exercise any of the
permissions granted to You under this License and for at least one
year thereafter.

#### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work

Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each
Recipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to
those portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as
the modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source
Code corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be
provided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a
Compatible Open Source License.

A “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source 
Initiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under 
this License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be 
distributed together as a single work.

#### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular
modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the "Embargo
Period") if:

+ a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified
vulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,

+ b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end
of the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one
or more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,

+ c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the
vulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees,
and

+ d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is
provided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.

### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy

In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access
to the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this
License to interfere with a Recipient's ability to fully use an
independent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You
provide with the Recipient's own User Data.

"User Data" means any data that is an input to or an output from the
Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially
identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the
Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest,
an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by,
for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.

#### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data

Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions
granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any
Recipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,
provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient's User
Data in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is
available to You for use in conjunction with the Work.

#### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access

You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to
anything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of
cryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological
protection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient's
ability to access any functionality present in Recipient's independent
copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the
Recipient's User Data.

#### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access

You may not contractually restrict a Recipient's ability to
independently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You
waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection
measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that
the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of
enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution

You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices
contained in the Source Code (the "Notices"), and provide all such
Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the
use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or
via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing
Access to Source Code.

### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License

You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only
relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than
providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source
Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in
this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage
in network interactions with anyone.

### 4.5. Combined Work Exception

As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to
Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having
the "Combined Work Exception," or any object code exclusively
resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other
Software into a "Larger Work." So long as you comply with the
requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access
to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide
Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient's
ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software
in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be
licensed under the terms of your choice.

## 5. Term and Termination

The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and
continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or
until all Licensor's intellectual property rights in the Software
expire, whichever comes first ("Term"). This License cannot be
revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.

### 5.1. Effect of Termination

If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted
to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You
will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this
License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement

This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any
of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination
for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License
will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all
the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified
by Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your
noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for
the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after
becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the
Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance
lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for
noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are
specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation

If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the
Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You
by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to
litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License,
directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative
review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in
response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former
Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due
to litigation.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability

As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty
of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone
for any damages related to this software or this license, under any
kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a
result of this License or the use of the Work including, without
limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses.

## 7. Other Provisions
### 7.1. Affiliates

An "Affiliate" means any other entity that, directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and
natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services
to Licensee are also Affiliates.

### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law

A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating
to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only
in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a
particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if
Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to
all Licensees.

### 7.3. No Sublicensing

This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a
Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a
license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose
any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any
Recipients' exercise of the permissions granted herein.

### 7.4. Attorneys' Fees

In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages
relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any
appeal of such action. A "prevailing party" is the party that
achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through
settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

### 7.5. No Waiver

Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will
not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit
Licensor's ability to enforce such provision at a later time.

### 7.6. Severability

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted
to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a
construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion
will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will
remain in full force and effect.
