    "Do No Harm License\n\nVersion 0.1, August 2018\n\nhttps://github.com/raisely/NoHarm\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n1. Preamble\n\nMost software today is developed with little to no thought of how it will be used, or the\nconsequences for our society and planet.\n\nAs software developers, we engineer the infrastructure of the 21st century. We recognise that our\ninfrastructure has great power to shape the world and the lives of those we share it with, and we\nchoose to consciously take responsibility for the social and environmental impacts of what we build.\n\nWe envisage a world free from injustice, inequality, and the reckless destruction of lives and our\nplanet. We reject slavery in all its forms, whether by force, indebtedness, or by algorithms that\nhack human vulnerabilities. We seek a world where humankind is at peace with our neighbours, nature,\nand ourselves. We want our work to enrich the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of all\nsociety.\n\nWe build software to further this vision of a just world, or at the very least, to not put that\nvision further from reach.\n\n2.
