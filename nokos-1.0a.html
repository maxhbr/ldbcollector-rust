DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.\n\n3.1 Application of License.\n\n\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the\nterms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code\nversion of Covered Software may be distributed only under the terms of this License\nor a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include\na copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not\noffer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the\napplicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You\nmay include an additional document offering the additional rights described in\nSection 3.5.\n\n3.2 Availability of Source Code.\n\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available\nin Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an\nExecutable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to\nwhom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after\nthe date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent\nversion of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients.\nYou are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even\nif the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n3.3 Description of Modifications.\n\nYou must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a file\ndocumenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date of any\nchange. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,\ndirectly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Nokia and including the\nname of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version\nor related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered\nSoftware.\n\n3.4  Intellectual Property Matters\n\n(a) Third Party Claims.\n\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual\nproperty rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under\nSections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\ndistribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim\nin sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor\nobtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in\nSection 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\nContributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying\nappropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who\nreceived the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n(b) Contributor APIs.\n\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and\nContributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to\nimplement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n(c) Representations.\n\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above,\nContributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original\ncreation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\nthis License.\n\n3.5 Required Notices.\n\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is\nnot possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\nstructure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant\ndirectory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one\nor more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice\ndescribed in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for\nthe Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to\nCovered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia\nor any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby\nagree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or\nsuch Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You\noffer.\n\n3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\nYou may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the requirements of\nSection 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, and if You include a notice\nstating that the Source Code version of the Covered Software is available under the\nterms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled\nthe obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any\nnotice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You\ndescribe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the\nExecutable version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your\nchoice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\ncompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable\nversion does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code\nversion from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable\nversion under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms\nwhich differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any\nContributor. You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You\noffer.\n\n3.7 Larger Works.\n\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other software not\ngoverned by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single\nproduct. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are\nfulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\n4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with\nrespect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or\nregulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum\nextent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such\ndescription must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be\nincluded with all distributions of the Source Code.\n\nExcept to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\nsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.\n\nThis License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in Exhibit A and\nto related Covered Software.\n\n6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.\n\n\n6.1 New Versions.\n\nNokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each\nversion will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n6.2 Effect of New Versions.\n\nOnce Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the License,\nYou may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also\nchoose to use such Covered Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the\nLicense published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia has the right to modify the terms\napplicable to Covered Software created under this License.\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\nCOVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\nWARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE\nDEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER\nCONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS\nDISCLAIMER OF  WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY\nCOVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You\nfail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\nbecoming aware of the breach.
