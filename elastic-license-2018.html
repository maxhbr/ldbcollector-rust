    "ELASTIC LICENSE AGREEMENT\n\nPLEASE READ CAREFULLY THIS ELASTIC LICENSE AGREEMENT (THIS \"AGREEMENT\"), WHICH\nCONSTITUTES A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT AND GOVERNS ALL OF YOUR USE OF ALL OF\nTHE ELASTIC SOFTWARE WITH WHICH THIS AGREEMENT IS INCLUDED (\"ELASTIC SOFTWARE\")\nTHAT IS PROVIDED IN OBJECT CODE FORMAT, AND, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 2 BELOW,\nCERTAIN OF THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE THAT IS PROVIDED IN SOURCE CODE FORMAT. BY\nINSTALLING OR USING ANY OF THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT, YOU\nARE ASSENTING TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE\nWITH SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL OR USE THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE\nGOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE ON\nBEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE ACTUAL\nAUTHORITY TO AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF\nSUCH ENTITY.\n\nPosted Date: April 20, 2018\n\nThis Agreement is entered into by and between Elasticsearch BV (\"Elastic\") and\nYou, or the legal entity on behalf of whom You are acting (as applicable,\n\"You\").\n\n1. OBJECT CODE END USER LICENSES, RESTRICTIONS AND THIRD PARTY OPEN SOURCE\nSOFTWARE\n\n  1.1 Object Code End User License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n  Section 1.2 of this Agreement, Elastic hereby grants to You, AT NO CHARGE and\n  for so long as you are not in breach of any provision of this Agreement, a\n  License to the Basic Features and Functions of the Elastic Software.\n\n  1.2 Reservation of Rights; Restrictions. As between Elastic and You, Elastic\n  and its licensors own all right, title and interest in and to the Elastic\n  Software, and except as expressly set forth in Sections 1.1, and 2.1 of this\n  Agreement, no other license to the Elastic Software is granted to You under\n  this Agreement, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. You agree not to: (i)\n  reverse engineer or decompile, decrypt, disassemble or otherwise reduce any\n  Elastic Software provided to You in Object Code, or any portion thereof, to\n  Source Code, except and only to the extent any such restriction is prohibited\n  by applicable law, (ii) except as expressly permitted in this Agreement,\n  prepare derivative works from, modify, copy or use the Elastic Software Object\n  Code or the Commercial Software Source Code in any manner; (iii) except as\n  expressly permitted in Section 1.1 above, transfer, sell, rent, lease,\n  distribute, sublicense, loan or otherwise transfer, Elastic Software Object\n  Code, in whole or in part, to any third party; (iv) use Elastic Software\n  Object Code for providing time-sharing services, any software-as-a-service,\n  service bureau services or as part of an application services provider or\n  other service offering (collectively, \"SaaS Offering\") where obtaining access\n  to the Elastic Software or the features and functions of the Elastic Software\n  is a primary reason or substantial motivation for users of the SaaS Offering\n  to access and/or use the SaaS Offering (\"Prohibited SaaS Offering\"); (v)\n  circumvent the limitations on use of Elastic Software provided to You in\n  Object Code format that are imposed or preserved by any License Key, or (vi)\n  alter or remove any Marks and Notices in the Elastic Software. If You have any\n  question as to whether a specific SaaS Offering constitutes a Prohibited SaaS\n  Offering, or are interested in obtaining Elastic's permission to engage in\n  commercial or non-commercial distribution of the Elastic Software, please\n  contact elastic_license@elastic.co.\n\n  1.3 Third Party Open Source Software. The Commercial Software may contain or\n  be provided with third party open source libraries, components, utilities and\n  other open source software (collectively, \"Open Source Software\"), which Open\n  Source Software may have applicable license terms as identified on a website\n  designated by Elastic. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, use of\n  the Open Source Software shall be subject to the license terms and conditions\n  applicable to such Open Source Software, to the extent required by the\n  applicable licensor (which terms shall not restrict the license rights granted\n  to You hereunder, but may contain additional rights). To the extent any\n  condition of this Agreement conflicts with any license to the Open Source\n  Software, the Open Source Software license will govern with respect to such\n  Open Source Software only. Elastic may also separately provide you with\n  certain open source software that is licensed by Elastic. Your use of such\n  Elastic open source software will not be governed by this Agreement, but by\n  the applicable open source license terms.\n\n2. COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE SOURCE CODE\n\n  2.1 Limited License. Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.2 of\n  this Agreement, Elastic hereby grants to You, AT NO CHARGE and for so long as\n  you are not in breach of any provision of this Agreement, a limited,\n  non-exclusive, non-transferable, fully paid up royalty free right and license\n  to the Commercial Software in Source Code format, without the right to grant\n  or authorize sublicenses, to prepare Derivative Works of the Commercial\n  Software, provided You (i) do not hack the licensing mechanism, or otherwise\n  circumvent the intended limitations on the use of Elastic Software to enable\n  features other than Basic Features and Functions or those features You are\n  entitled to as part of a Subscription, and (ii) use the resulting object code\n  only for reasonable testing purposes.\n\n  2.2 Restrictions. Nothing in Section 2.1 grants You the right to (i) use the\n  Commercial Software Source Code other than in accordance with Section 2.1\n  above, (ii) use a Derivative Work of the Commercial Software outside of a\n  Non-production Environment, in any production capacity, on a temporary or\n  permanent basis, or (iii) transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, sublicense,\n  loan or otherwise make available the Commercial Software Source Code, in whole\n  or in part, to any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may\n  maintain a copy of the repository in which the Source Code of the Commercial\n  Software resides and that copy may be publicly accessible, provided that you\n  include this Agreement with Your copy of the repository.\n\n3. TERMINATION\n\n  3.1 Termination. This Agreement will automatically terminate, whether or not\n  You receive notice of such Termination from Elastic, if You breach any of its\n  provisions.\n\n  3.2 Post Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, for any reason,\n  You shall promptly cease the use of the Elastic Software in Object Code format\n  and cease use of the Commercial Software in Source Code format. For the\n  avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement will not affect Your right\n  to use Elastic Software, in either Object Code or Source Code formats, made\n  available under the Apache License Version 2.0.\n\n  3.3 Survival. Sections 1.2, 2.2. 3.3, 4 and 5 shall survive any termination or\n  expiration of this Agreement.\n\n4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n  4.1 Disclaimer of Warranties. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE\n  LAW, THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n  AND ELASTIC AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR\n  STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT\n  PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ELASTIC AND ITS LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY\n  DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n  PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE, AND WITH\n  RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE FOREGOING. FURTHER, ELASTIC DOES NOT WARRANT RESULTS\n  OF USE OR THAT THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR THAT THE USE OF THE\n  ELASTIC SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED.\n\n  4.2 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL ELASTIC OR ITS LICENSORS BE\n  LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES,\n  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS\n  INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY\n  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, IN CONNECTION WITH\n  OR ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE, OR THE\n  PERFORMANCE OF OR FAILURE TO PERFORM THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A\n  BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF ELASTIC\n  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n5. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n  This Agreement completely and exclusively states the entire agreement of the\n  parties regarding the subject matter herein, and it supersedes, and its terms\n  govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the\n  parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. This Agreement may be\n  modified by Elastic from time to time, and any such modifications will be\n  effective upon the \"Posted Date\" set forth at the top of the modified\n  Agreement. If any provision hereof is held unenforceable, this Agreement will\n  continue without said provision and be interpreted to reflect the original\n  intent of the parties. This Agreement and any non-contractual obligation\n  arising out of or in connection with it, is governed exclusively by Dutch law.\n  This Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 UN Convention on Contracts\n  for the International Sale of Goods. All disputes arising out of or in\n  connection with this Agreement, including its existence and validity, shall be\n  resolved by the courts with jurisdiction in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, except\n  where mandatory law provides for the courts at another location in The\n  Netherlands to have jurisdiction. The parties hereby irrevocably waive any and\n  all claims and defenses either might otherwise have in any such action or\n  proceeding in any of such courts based upon any alleged lack of personal\n  jurisdiction, improper venue, forum non conveniens or any similar claim or\n  defense. A breach or threatened breach, by You of Section 2 may cause\n  irreparable harm for which damages at law may not provide adequate relief, and\n  therefore Elastic shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief without being\n  required to post a bond. You may not assign this Agreement (including by\n  operation of law in connection with a merger or acquisition), in whole or in\n  part to any third party without the prior written consent of Elastic, which\n  may be withheld or granted by Elastic in its sole and absolute discretion.\n  Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is void. Notices to\n  Elastic may also be sent to legal@elastic.co.\n\n6.
