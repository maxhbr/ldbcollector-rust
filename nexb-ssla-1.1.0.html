8.	INDEMNIFICATION

(a)	nexB will defend and indemnify Licensee for all reasonable costs arising from a claim that Software furnished and used within the scope of this Agreement infringes a U.S. copyright or U.S. patent provided that:

(ii) nexB has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations, and
(iii) Licensee provides nexB with the assistance, information, and authority necessary to perform the above.

(b)	nexB will have no liability for any claim of infringement based on:
(i) code contained within the Software which was not created by nexB including, but not limited to, the third-party software or Open Source Software;
(ii) use of a superseded or altered release of the Software, except for such alteration(s) or modification(s) which have been made by nexB or under nexB's direction, if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current, unaltered release of the Software that nexB provides to Licensee, or
(iii) the combination, operation, or use of any Software furnished under this Agreement with programs or data not furnished by nexB if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Software without such programs or data.

(a)	In no event will nexB be liable to Licensee or any third party for any incidental or consequential damages (including, without limitation, indirect, special, punitive, or exemplary damages for loss of business, loss of profits, business interruption, or loss of business information) arising out of the use of or inability to use the Software, or for any claim by any other party, even if nexB has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

(b)	nexB's aggregate liability with respect to its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the Software, Content and Documentation or otherwise shall not exceed the Subscription Fees received by nexB from Licensee during the 12 month period immediately preceding the event that gave rise to the claim. Because some states and/or countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply.
