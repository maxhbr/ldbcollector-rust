Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by notifying nexB. Upon the termination of this Agreement, Licensee must cease using the Software and delete the Software from its computers and archives.\n\n(b)\tDuring an Evaluation Period, nexB may terminate this License Agreement for convenience and for any or no reason and may, at its sole discretion, require Licensee to return the Software to nexB or discontinue Licensee access to the Software at any time.\n\n(c)\tIn addition to any other termination rights provided in this Agreement, either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days after delivery of a written notice describing the breach.\n\n14.\tMARKETING\nLicensee agrees to be identified as a customer of nexB and that nexB may refer to Licensee by name, trade name and trademark, if applicable, and may briefly describe Licensee's business in nexB's marketing materials, on nexB's web site, in public or legal documents.

Licensee shall pay or reimburse nexB for such taxes on or related to the Software unless an exemption certificate or a direct payment permit is provided to nexB.

Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of the parties thereto.
