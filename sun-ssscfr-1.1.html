III. RESEARCH USE RIGHTS
	A. From Original Contributor. Subject to and conditioned upon your full compliance with
	the terms and conditions of this License including Section IV (Restrictions and Licensee
	Responsibilities) and Section V.E.7 (International Use), Original Contributor:

		1. Grants to You a non-exclusive, worldwide and royalty-free license to the extent of
		Original Contributor's copyrights and trade secret rights in and covering the Reference
		Code and Technology Specifications to do the following for Your Research Use only:
		a. Reproduce and prepare derivative works of the Reference Code, in whole or in part,
		alone or as part of Covered Code; and

		2. will not, during the term of Your License, bring against You any claim alleging that
		Your using, making, having made, importing or distributing Licensee Code for Your
		Research Use, insofar as permitted under Section III.A.1 of this License, necessarily
		infringes any patent now owned or hereafter acquired by Original Contributor whose
		claims cover subject matter contained in or embodied by the Reference Code or which
		would necessarily be infringed by the use or distribution of any and all
		implementations of the Technology Specifications.

		3. grants to You a non-exclusive, worldwide and royalty-free license, to the extent of its
		intellectual property rights therein, to use (i) Original Contributor's class, interface and
		package names only insofar as necessary to accurately reference or invoke Your
		Modifications for Research Use, and (ii) any associated software tools, documents and
		information provided by Original Contributor at the Technology Site for use in
		exercising the above license rights.

	Responsibilities) and V.E.7 (International Use), each Contributor:

		1. grants to each Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide and royalty-free license to the
		extent of such Contributor's copyrights and trade secret rights in and covering its
		Contributed Code, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, and distribute
		Contributed Code, in whole or in part, in source code and object code form, to the
		same extent as permitted under such Licensee's License with Original Contributor
		(including all supplements thereto).

		2. will not, during the term of the Licensee's License, bring against any Licensee any
		claim alleging that using, making, having made, importing or distributing Contributed
		Code as permitted under this License necessarily infringes any patent now owned or
		hereafter acquired by such Contributor whose claims would necessarily be infringed
		by the use or distribution of the Contributed Code. This covenant applies to the
		combination of the Contributed Code and the Reference Code if, at the time the
		Contributed Code is added to Reference Code, such addition of Contributed Code
		causes such combination to be covered by said patents. This covenant shall not apply
		to any other combinations which include the Contributed Code.

	C. Modifications. You covenant that You will not bring against Original Contributor and/or
	Solaris licensees any claim alleging that any patent now owned or hereafter acquired by
	You is infringed by Original Contributor and/or Solaris licensees where such patent is
	related to Modifications to the Reference Code or based on Reference Code. Any
	permitted transfer of this Agreement, your Modifications, or such patent must be subject
	to this covenant.

	D. No Implied Licenses. Neither party is granted any right or license other than the licenses
	and covenants expressly set out herein. Other than the licenses and covenants expressly
	set out herein, Original Contributor retains all right, title and interest in Reference Code

	originate from Original Contributor.

IV. RESTRICTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

As a condition to Your license and other rights and immunities, You must comply with the
restrictions and responsibilities set forth below.

	A. Source Code Availability. You may provide Contributed Code to Original Contributor at
	any time, in Your discretion. Original Contributor will post Your Contributed Code and
	Contributed Code Specifications on the Technology Site.

	B. Notices. You must reproduce without alteration copyright and other proprietary notices
	in any Covered Code that You create. The statement "Use and Distribution is subject to
	the Sun Solaris Source Code (Foundation Release) License available at
	"http://www.sun.com/solaris/source" must appear prominently in Your Modifications
	and, in all cases, in the same file as all Your copyright and other proprietary notices.

	C. Modifications. You must include a "diff" file with Your Contributed Code that identifies
	and details the changes or additions You made, the version of Reference Code or
	Contributed Code You used and the date of such changes or additions. In addition, you
	must provide any Contributed Code Specifications for Your Contributed Code. Your
	Modifications are Covered Code and You expressly agree that use and distribution, in
	whole or in part, of Your Modifications shall only be done in accordance with and
	subject to this License.

	D. Extensions.

		1. You may create and add "Interfaces" but, unless expressly permitted at the Technology
		Site, You may not incorporate any Reference Code in Your Interfaces. If You choose to
		disclose or permit disclosure of Your Interfaces to even a single third party for the
		purposes of enabling such third party to independently develop and distribute (directly
		or indirectly) technology which invokes such Interfaces, You must then make the
		Interfaces open by (i) promptly following completion thereof, publishing to the
		industry, on a non-confidential basis and free of all copyright restrictions, a reasonably
		detailed, current and accurate specification for the Interfaces, and (ii) as soon as
		reasonably possible, but in no event more than thirty (30) days following publication
		of Your specification, making available on reasonable terms and without
		discrimination, a reasonably complete and practicable test suite and methodology
		adequate to create and test implementations of the Interfaces by a reasonably skilled
		technologist.

		2. You shall not assert any intellectual property rights You may have covering Your
		Interfaces which would necessarily be infringed by the creation, use or distribution of
		all reasonable independent implementations of your specification of such Interfaces by
		Sun Solaris Source Code (FR) License 6 December 4, 2000
		a Licensee or Original Contributor. Nothing herein is intended to prevent You from
		enforcing any of Your intellectual property rights covering Your specific
		implementation of Your Interfaces or functionality using such Interfaces other than as
		specifically set forth in this Section D.2.

	E. Confidential Information. You agree to treat the Reference Code as confidential
	information of the Original Contributor. Reference Code will not be provided by You to
	any third party. You will establish appropriate procedures to prevent the disclosure of
	such Reference Code.

	F. Sharing of Covered Code. You may not share Covered Code with any non-Licensee
	under any circumstances. You may only share Covered Code with other Licensees on
	the Technology Site, consistent with any rules or guidelines set forth in this Agreement
	and the Technology Site.

V. GOVERNANCE

	accepted Reference Code, Technology Specifications, Contributed Code and/or
	Contributed Code Specifications under a version of this License, You may always
	continue to use such version of Reference Code, Technology Specifications, Contributed
	Code and/or Contributed Code Specifications under that version of the License. New code
	and specifications which You may subsequently choose to accept will be subject to any
	new License in effect at the time of Your acceptance of such code and specifications.

	B. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.
		1. AS IS. COVERED CODE AND ALL SPECIFICATIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS",
		WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
		INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT ANY COVERED
		CODE OR SPECIFICATIONS ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT
		FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING OF THIRD PARTY
		RIGHTS. YOU AGREE THAT YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK IN CONNECTION
		WITH YOUR USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANY AND ALL COVERED CODE
		OR SPECIFICATIONS UNDER THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
		CODE OR SPECIFICATIONS IS AUTHORIZED EXCEPT SUBJECT TO AND IN
		CONSIDERATION FOR THIS DISCLAIMER.

		2. You understand that, although each Licensee grants the licenses set forth in the License,
		no assurances are provided by any Licensee that Covered Code or any specifications do
		not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party.
		Sun Solaris Source Code (FR) License 7 December 4, 2000

		3. Hazardous Applications. You acknowledge that Reference Code and Technology
		Specifications are neither designed nor intended for use in the design, construction,
		operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility.

	C. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.

		1. Infringement. Each Licensee disclaims any liability to all other Licensee for claims
		brought by any third party based on infringement of intellectual property rights. Original
		Contributor represents that, to its knowledge, it has sufficient copyrights to allow You to
		use and distribute the Reference Code as herein permitted and You represent that, to
		Your knowledge, You have sufficient copyrights to allow each Licensee and Original
		Contributor to use and distribute Your Shared Modifications and Error Corrections as
		contemplated herein. You agree to notify Original Contributor should You become
		aware of any potential or actual infringement of the Technology or any of Original
		Contributor's intellectual property rights in the Technology, Reference Code or
		Technology Specifications.

		2. Suspension. If any portion of, or functionality implemented by, the Reference Code,
		Technology or Technology Specifications becomes the subject of a claim or threatened
		claim of infringement ("Affected Materials"), Original Contributor may, in its
		unrestricted discretion, suspend Your rights to use and distribute the Affected Materials
		under this License. Such suspension of rights will be effective immediately upon
		Original Contributor's posting of notice of suspension on the Technology Site. Original
		Contributor has no obligation to lift the suspension of rights relative to the Affected
		Materials until a final, non-appealable determination is made by a court or governmental
		agency of competent jurisdiction that Original Contributor is legally able, without the
		payment of a fee or royalty, to reinstate Your rights to the Affected Materials to the full
		extent contemplated hereunder. Upon such determination, Original Contributor will lift
		the suspension by posting a notice to such effect on the Technology Site. Nothing herein
		shall be construed to prevent You, at Your option and expense, and subject to applicable
		law and the restrictions and responsibilities set forth in this License and any
		Supplements, from replacing Reference Code in Affected Materials with non-infringing
		code or independently negotiating, without compromising or prejudicing Original
		Contributor's position, to obtain the rights necessary to use Affected Materials as herein
		permitted.

		3. Disclaimer. ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTOR'S LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS
		RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR ANY SUPPLEMENT HERETO, WHETHER
		FOR BREACH OR TORT, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF ONE THOUSAND
		DOLLARS (US $1000.00) OR THE FULL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE
		MATERIALS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, IF ANY. IN NO EVENT WILL
		ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE,
		SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN CONNECTION
		WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
		LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, DATA OR ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE OF
		Sun Solaris Source Code (FR) License 8 December 4, 2000
		ANY SORT), HOWEVER IT ARISES AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY
		WHETHER OR NOT ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
		POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND NOTWITHSTANDING FAILURE OF THE
		ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.

	D. TERMINATION.
	You may terminate this License at any time by notifying Original Contributor in writing.
	All Your rights will terminate under this License if You fail to comply with any of the
	material terms or conditions of this License and do not cure such failure in a reasonable
	period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance.

	If You institute patent litigation against a Licensee with respect to a patent applicable to
	Licensee Code, then any patent licenses granted by such Licensee to You under this
	License shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if You institute
	patent litigation against any Licensee or Original Contributor alleging that Reference
	Code, Technology or Technology Specifications infringe Your patent(s), then the rights
	granted to You under Section III.A above will terminate.

	Upon termination, You must discontinue all uses and distribution of Licensee Code,
	except that You may continue to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of Your
	Modifications (without the benefit of any license arising from this License) for purposes
	other than to implement functionality designated in any portion of the Technology
	Specifications. Properly granted sublicenses to third parties will survive termination.
	Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect following termination survive.

	E. MISCELLANEOUS.
		1. Trademark. You agree to comply with Original Contributor's Trademark & Logo Usage
		Requirements, as modified from time to time, available at the Technology Site. Except
		as expressly provided in this License, You are granted no rights in or to any "Sun",
		"Solaris", "Jini", "Jiro" or "Java" trademarks now or hereafter used or licensed by
		Original Contributor (the "Sun Trademarks"). You agree not to (i) challenge Original
		Contributor's ownership or use of Sun Trademarks; (ii) attempt to register any Sun

		be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable unless to do so would defeat
		the intent of the parties.

		4. Governing Law. This License is governed by the laws of the United States and the State
		of California, as applied to contracts entered into and performed in California between
		Sun Solaris Source Code (FR) License 9 December 4, 2000
		California residents. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
		Sale of Goods shall not apply. Nor shall any law or regulation which provides that a
		contract be construed against the drafter.

		5. Dispute Resolution.
		a. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this License shall be finally settled by
		arbitration as set forth in this Section, except that either party may bring an action in a
		court of competent jurisdiction (which jurisdiction shall be exclusive), relative to any
		dispute relating to such party's intellectual property rights. Arbitration will be
		administered (i) by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), (ii) in accordance
		with the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
		(UNCITRAL) (the "Rules") in effect at the time of arbitration, modified as set forth
		herein, and (iii) the arbitrator will apply the governing laws required under Section E.4
		above. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
		court having jurisdiction to enforce such award. The arbitrator may not award damages
		in excess of or of a different type than those permitted by this License and any such
		award is void.
		b. All proceedings will be in English and conducted by a single arbitrator selected in
		accordance with the Rules who is fluent in English, familiar with technology matters
		pertinent in the dispute and either a retired judge or practicing attorney having at least
		ten (10) years litigation experience. Venue for arbitration will be in San Francisco,
		California, unless the parties agree otherwise. Each party will be required to produce
		documents relied upon in the arbitration and to respond to no more than twenty-five
		single question interrogatories. All awards are payable in US dollars and may include
		for the prevailing party (i) pre-judgment interest, (ii) reasonable attorney's fees
		incurred in connection with the arbitration, and (iii) reasonable costs and expenses
		incurred in enforcing the award.

		6. U.S. Government: If this Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S.
		Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),
		then the Government's rights in this Software and accompanying documentation shall be
		only as set forth in this license; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through
		227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and
		12.212 (for non-DoD acquisitions).

		7. International Use.
		a. Covered Code is subject to US export control laws and may be subject to export or
		import regulations in other countries. Each party shall comply fully with all such laws
		and regulations and acknowledges its responsibility to obtain such licenses to export,
		re-export or import as may be required. You must pass through these obligations to all
		Your licensees.
		Sun Solaris Source Code (FR) License 10 December 4, 2000
