The Licensor is under no obligation to respond to any technical questions or inquiries, or provide any other user support in connection with the installation, use or the Reproduction and Other Exploitation of the Licensed Program or Derived Programs thereof.\n\nArticle 4 (Termination of Agreement)\n\n1.
