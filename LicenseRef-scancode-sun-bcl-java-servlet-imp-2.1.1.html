    "Java Servlet Implementation Classes\nVersion 2.1.1\nBinary Code License\n\nThis binary code license (\"License\") contains rights and restrictions \nassociated with use of the accompanying Java Servlet Implementation Classes \nsoftware and documentation (\"Software\").  Read the License carefully before \nusing the Software.  By using the Software you agree to the terms and \nconditions of this License.\n\n 1. Limited License Grant.  By agreeing to this License, Sun grants to you \n    (\"Licensee\") a non-exclusive, nontransferable limited license to use the \n    Software without fee for evaluation of the Software and for development \n    of applications which utilize the Software.  Licensee may make one archival \n    copy of the Software and may redistribute complete, unmodified copies of \n    the Software to software developers within the Licensee's organization to \n    avoid unnecessary download time provided that this License conspicuously \n    appear with all copies of the Software.  Except for the foregoing and the \n    distribution rights authorized for the Servlet Classes specified below, \n    Licensee may not redistribute the Software in whole or in part, either \n    separately or included with a product.\n\n 2. License to Distribute Servlet Classes.  Licensee is granted a royalty-free \n    right to reproduce and distribute the binary code form of the servlet \n    classes contained in the Software in the archive file \"servlet.jar\" \n    (\"Servlet Classes\"), provided that Licensee: (i) distributes the Servlet \n    Classes complete and unmodified in their original Java Archive file, and \n    only as a part of Licensee's application that incorporates the Servlet \n    Classes (\"Program\"); (ii) does not distribute additional software intended \n    to replace any components of the Servlet Classes; (iii) agrees to \n    incorporate the most current version of the Servlet Classes that was \n    available from Sun no later than 180 days prior to each production release \n    of Program; (iv) does not remove or alter any proprietary legends or \n    notices contained in the Servlet Classes; (v) includes the provisions of \n    Sections 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 in Licensee's license agreement for the Program;\n    and (vi) agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Sun and its \n    licensors from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorneys' \n    fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of the Software.\n\n 3. Java Platform Interface.  Licensee may not modify the Java Platform \n    Interface (JPI, identified as classes contained within the javax package \n    or any subpackages of the javax package), by creating additional classes \n    within the JPI or otherwise causing the addition to or modification of \n    the classes in the JPI.  In the event that Licensee creates any \n    Java-related API and distribute such API to others for applet or \n    application development, you must promptly publish broadly, an accurate \n    specification for such API for free use by all developers of Java-based \n    software.  \n\n  4. Restrictions.  Software is confidential copyrighted information of Sun and \n     title to all copies is retained by Sun and/or its licensors.  Licensee \n     shall not modify, decompile, disassemble, decrypt, extract, or otherwise \n     reverse engineer Software.  Software may not be leased, assigned, or \n     sublicensed, in whole or in part.  Software is not designed or intended \n     for use in on-line control of aircraft, air traffic, aircraft navigation \n     or aircraft communications; or in the design, construction, operation or \n     maintenance of any nuclear facility.  Licensee warrants that it will not \n     use or redistribute the Software for such purposes.\n\n  5. Trademarks and Logos.  This License does not authorize Licensee to use any \n     Sun name,    trademark or logo.  Licensee acknowledges that Sun owns the \n     Java trademark and all Java- related trademarks, logos and icons including\n     the Coffee Cup and Duke (\"Java Marks\") and agrees to: (i) to comply with \n     the Java Trademark Guidelines at http://java.sun.com/ trademarks.html; \n     (ii) not do anything harmful to or inconsistent with Sun's rights in the \n     Java Marks; and (iii) assist Sun in protecting those rights, including \n     assigning to Sun any rights acquired by Licensee in any Java Mark.  \n\n  6. Disclaimer of Warranty.  Software is provided \"AS IS,\" without a warranty \n     of any kind.    ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, \n     INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A \n     PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED.  \n\n  7. Limitation of Liability.  SUN AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR \n     ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF USING \n     OR DISTRIBUTING SOFTWARE.  IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE \n     LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, \n     SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED \n     AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR \n     INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY \n     OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  8. Termination.  This License is effective until terminated.  Licensee may \n     terminate this License at any time by destroying all copies of Software.  \n     This License will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if Licensee\n     fails to comply with any provision of this License.  Upon such termination,\n     Licensee must destroy all copies of Software.\n\n  9. Export Regulations.  Software, including technical data, is subject to U.S.\n     export control laws, including the U.S.  Export Administration Act and its\n     associated regulations, and may be subject to export or import regulations\n     in other countries.  Licensee agrees to comply strictly with all such \n     regulations and acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain \n     licenses to export, re-export, or import Software.  Software may not be \n     downloaded, or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into, or to a national\n     or resident of, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Sudan, Syria or any \n     country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the \n     U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nations or the U.S.\n     Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders.\n\n  10. Restricted Rights.  Use, duplication or disclosure by the United States \n     government is subject to the restrictions as set forth in the Rights in \n     Technical Data and Computer Software Clauses in DFARS 252.227-7013(c) \n     (1) (ii) and FAR 52.227-19(c) (2) as applicable.\n\n  11. Governing Law.  Any action related to this License will be governed by \n     California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules \n     of any jurisdiction will apply.  \n\n  12. Severability.  If any of the above provisions are held to be in \n     violation of applicable law, void, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, \n     then such provisions are herewith waived to the extent necessary for the \n     License to be otherwise enforceable in such jurisdiction.  However, if in \n     Sun's opinion deletion of any provisions of the License by operation of \n     this paragraph unreasonably compromises the rights or increase the \n     liabilities of Sun or its licensors, Sun reserves the right to terminate \n     the License and refund the fee paid by Licensee, if any, as Licensee's \n     sole and exclusive remedy. \n\n  13. Integration. This Agreement is the entire agreement between Licensee and \n     Sun relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or \n     contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations\n     and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of \n     any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the \n     parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement. \n     No modification of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and \n     signed by an authorized representative of each party.",
