THIS IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND AMAZON WEB SERVICES, INC. (WITH ITS AFFILIATES, "AWS" OR "WE")
THAT GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE AMAZON REDSHIFT JDBC DRIVER SOFTWARE (TOGETHER WITH ANY UPDATES
AND ENHANCEMENTS TO IT, AND ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION, THE "SOFTWARE") THAT WE MAKE
AVAILABLE TO YOU (THIS "LICENSE AGREEMENT"). IF YOU INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE, YOU WILL BE BOUND
BY THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT. UNLESS OTHERWISE DEFINED IN THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, CAPITALIZED TERMS
WILL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS SET FORTH IN THE AWS CUSTOMER AGREEMENT POSTED AT
AWS.AMAZON.COM/AGREEMENT (THE "AWS CUSTOMER AGREEMENT").

1. Use of the Software
We hereby grant you a personal, limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to install and
use the Software on computer equipment owned or controlled by you solely to access Amazon Redshift for your
internal business purposes. Some components of the Software (whether developed by AWS or third parties) may
be governed by applicable open source software licenses. Your license rights with respect to these individual
components are defined by the applicable open source software licenses, and nothing in this License Agreement
will restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations you may have, or conditions to which you may be
subject, under such open source software licenses.

2. Limitations
You may not, and you will not encourage, assist or authorize any other person to, (a) incorporate any portion of
the Software into your own programs or compile any portion of it in combination with your own programs; (b) sell,
rent, lease, lend, loan, distribute, act as a service bureau, publicly communicate, transform, or sub-license the
Software or otherwise assign any rights to the Software in whole or in part; (c) modify, alter, tamper with, repair,
or otherwise create derivative works of the Software, (d) reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the
Software or apply any other process or procedure to derive the source code of any software included in the
Software, or (e) access or use the Software or the Service in a way intended to avoid incurring fees or exceeding
usage limits or quotas.

3. Reservation of Rights
You may not use the Software for any illegal purpose. The Software is the intellectual property of AWS or its
licensors. The structure, organization, and code of the Software are valuable trade secrets and confidential
information of AWS. The Software is protected by law, including without limitation copyright laws and
international treaty provisions. Except for the rights explicitly granted to you in this License Agreement, all right,
title and interest in the Software are reserved and retained by us and our licensors. You do not acquire any
intellectual property or other rights in the Software as a result of downloading the Software.

4. Updates
In order to keep the Software up-to-date, we may offer automatic or manual updates at any time. If we elect to
provide maintenance or support of any kind, we may terminate that maintenance or support at any time without
notice to you.

5. Termination
You may terminate this License Agreement at any time by uninstalling or destroying all copies of the Software that
are in your possession or control. Your rights under this License Agreement will immediately and automatically
terminate if you do not comply with any term or condition of this License Agreement or the AWS Customer
Agreement, including any failure to remit timely payment. In the case of termination, you must cease all use and
destroy all copies of the Software. We may modify, suspend, discontinue, or terminate your right to use part or all
of the Software at any time without notice to you, and in that event we may modify the Software to make it 
inoperable. AWS will not be liable to you should it exercise those rights. Our failure to insist upon or enforce your
strict compliance with this License Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights.

6. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

a. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT INSTALLATION AND USE OF, AND ANY OTHER ACCESS TO,
THE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE APPLICATION IS DELIVERED TO YOU "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS AND
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND AWS, ITS LICENSORS AND DISTRIBUTORS, AND EACH OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "RELEASED PARTIES") DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ORAL OR
WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY A RELEASED PARTY OR AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF A
RELEASED PARTY WILL CREATE A WARRANTY. THE LAWS OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS,
EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

b. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, NO RELEASED PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT,
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY RELATED TO THE APPLICATION, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE OF THE
APPLICATION, EVEN IF A RELEASED PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY
CASE, ANY RELEASED PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO
$50.00. THE LAWS OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS OR
LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

7. Indemnification
You are liable for and will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Released Parties and their officers, directors,
agents, and employees, from and against any liability, loss, damage, cost, or expense (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees) arising out of your use of the Software, violation of the License Agreement, violation of applicable
law, or violation of any right of any person or entity, including without limitation intellectual property rights.

8. Source Code
Please see the Amazon Redshift technical documentation located on the AWS website (aws.amazon.com) for
information on how to retrieve a copy of the source code for certain software components included with the
Software.

9. Export Regulations
You will comply with all export and re-export restrictions and regulations of the United States Department of
Commerce and other United States and foreign agencies and authorities that may apply to the Software, and not
to transfer, or encourage, assist, or authorize the transfer of the Software to a prohibited country or otherwise in
violation of any applicable restrictions or regulations.

10. U.S. Government End Users
The Software is provided to the U.S. Government as "commercial items," "commercial computer software,"
"commercial computer software documentation," and "technical data" with the same rights and restrictions
generally applicable to the Software. If you are using the Software on behalf of the U.S. Government and these
terms fail to meet the U.S. Government’s needs or are inconsistent in any respect with federal law, you will
immediately discontinue your use of the Software. The terms "commercial item" "commercial computer 
software," "commercial computer software documentation," and "technical data" are defined in the Federal
Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.

11. Amendment
We may amend this License Agreement at our sole discretion by posting the revised terms on the AWS website
(aws.amazon.com) or within the Software. Your continued use of the Software after any amendment's effective
date evidences your agreement to be bound by it.

12. Conflicts
The terms of this License Agreement govern the Software and any updates or upgrades to the Software that we
may provide that replace or supplement the original Software, unless the update or upgrade is accompanied by a
separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.</pre><h5>Edge Origins:</h5><h5>Node Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>&larr;[AppliesTo] Unknown (Proprietary Free)</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(1056)"></div><pre>LicenseType(
