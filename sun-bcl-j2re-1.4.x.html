READ THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE
TERMS (COLLECTIVELY "AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY BEFORE OPENING THE SOFTWARE

1.  LICENSE TO USE.  Sun grants you a non-exclusive and
non-transferable license for the internal use only of the accompanying
software and documentation and any error corrections provided by Sun
(collectively "Software"), by the number of users and the class of
computer hardware for which the corresponding fee has been paid.

2.  RESTRICTIONS.  Software is confidential and copyrighted. Title to
Software and all associated intellectual property rights is retained
by Sun and/or its licensors.  Except as specifically authorized in any
Supplemental License Terms, you may not make copies of Software, other
than a single copy of Software for archival purposes.  Unless

decompile, or reverse engineer Software.  You acknowledge that
Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the design,
construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility.  Sun
disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses.
No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark, logo
or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this Agreement.

3.  LIMITED WARRANTY.  Sun warrants to you that for a period of ninety
(90) days from the date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the
receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be
free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except
for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive
remedy and Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be
at Sun's option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for
Software.

4.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

5.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE,
PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF
LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE
SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in
contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount
paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential purpose.

6.  Termination.  This Agreement is effective until terminated.  You
may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of
Software.  This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice
from Sun if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement.
Upon Termination, you must destroy all copies of Software.

7.  Export Regulations.  All Software and technical data delivered under
this Agreement are subject to US export control laws and may be
subject to export or import regulations in other countries.  You agree
to comply strictly with all such laws and regulations and acknowledge
that you have the responsibility to obtain such licenses to export,
re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you.

8.  U.S. Government Restricted Rights.  If Software is being acquired
by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S.  Government prime
contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's
rights in Software and accompanying documentation will be only as set
forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201
through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and
with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

9.  Governing Law.  Any action related to this Agreement will be
governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  No
choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

10.  Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the provision
omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in
which case this Agreement will immediately terminate.

11.  Integration.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between you
and Sun relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals,
representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or
additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other
communication between the parties relating to its subject matter
during the term of this Agreement.  No modification of this Agreement
will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized
representative of each party.
