TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Preamble

Most software today is developed with little to no thought of how it will be used, or the
consequences for our society and planet.

As software developers, we engineer the infrastructure of the 21st century. We recognise that our
infrastructure has great power to shape the world and the lives of those we share it with, and we
choose to consciously take responsibility for the social and environmental impacts of what we build.

We envisage a world free from injustice, inequality, and the reckless destruction of lives and our
planet. We reject slavery in all its forms, whether by force, indebtedness, or by algorithms that
hack human vulnerabilities. We seek a world where humankind is at peace with our neighbours, nature,
and ourselves. We want our work to enrich the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of all
society.

We build software to further this vision of a just world, or at the very least, to not put that
vision further from reach.

2. Definitions

Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this
License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the
License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or
derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other

License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or
bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any

"submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or
its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source
code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a

reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

4. Grant of Patent License

perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or
a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.

   file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own
   attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
   the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
   construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of
the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
Contributions.

of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

8. Disclaimer of Warranty

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

9. Limitation of Liability

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or
agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

10. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
additional liability.
