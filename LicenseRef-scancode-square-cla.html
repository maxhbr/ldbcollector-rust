Grant of Patent License.\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Square and to recipients of software distributed by Square a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contributions alone or by combination of Your Contributions with the Work to which such Contributions was Transmitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Representations and Warranties.\n\nYou represent and warrant that:\n * you are legally entitled to grant the above licenses;\n * if your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contribution, that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of an employer and that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Square, or that your employer has executed a separate Agreement with Square;\n * that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation; and\n * that Your Contributions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.\n\n 5. Submitting the Work of Others.\n\nShould You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Square separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as \"Transmitted on behalf of a third-party: [Insert name of third-party here].\"\n\n6.
