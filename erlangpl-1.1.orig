The Source\nCode version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms\nof this License, and You must include a copy of this License with\nevery copy of the Source Code You distribute.

You are responsible for ensuring that\nthe Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n3.3.

However, You may do so only on Your own\nbehalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,\nand You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\nContributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\nsuch Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\nliability terms You offer.\n\n3.6.

You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\nCode under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different\nfrom this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms\nof this License and that the license for the Executable version does\nnot attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source\nCode version from the rights set forth in this License. If You\ndistribute the Executable version under a different license You must\nmake it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License\nare offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\nevery Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\nor such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\nnot governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\nWork as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\nrequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute\nor regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\nto the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and\nthe code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL\nfile described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\ndistributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by\nstatute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed\nfor a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\nattached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. CONNECTION TO MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nThis Erlang License is a derivative work of the Mozilla Public\nLicense, Version 1.0. It contains terms which differ from the Mozilla\nPublic License, Version 1.0.\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\nDEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\nNON-INFRINGING.

All\nsublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\nsurvive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\nnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\nshall survive.\n\n9. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\nAny utilization of Covered Code shall not cause the Initial Developer\nor any Contributor to be liable for any damages (neither direct nor\nindirect).\n\n10. MISCELLANEOUS\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision is held to be unenforceable, such\nprovision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\nenforceable.
