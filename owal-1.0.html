© Copyright 2006 Opera Software ASA. All rights reserved.
OPERA SOFTWARE ASA ("OPERA") IS WILLING TO PERMIT USE OF THIS SOFTWARE
BY YOU, ONLY UPON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS
CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT. PLEASE READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BE BOUND, YOU ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO ACCESS THE CONTENTS OF, STUDY OR MAKE USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN
ANY WAY.

Terms of Agreement

1.Definitions
  a)"Original Code" means:
    The original version of the program accompanying this Agreement as
    released by Opera Software ASA ("OPERA"), including source code, object
    code and documentation, if any.
  b)"Covered Code" means:
    The Original Source Code, Contributions, the combination of the Original
    Code and Contributions, and/or any respective portions thereof.
  c)"Contribution" means:
    in the case of OPERA, the Original Code, and
    in the case of each Contributor, changes to the Original code, and
    additions to the Original Code; where such changes and/or additions to
    the Original Code originate from and are distributed by that particular
    Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was
    added to the Original Code by such Contributor itself or anyone acting
    on such Contributor's behalf.
    Contributions do not include additions to the Original Code which: (i)
    are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
    Original Code under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
    derivative works of the Original Code.
  d)"Contributor" means:
    OPERA and any other entity that distributes the Covered Code.
  e)"Recipient" means:
    Anyone who receives the Covered Code under this Agreement, including all
    Contributors.
  f)"Larger Work" means:
    A work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not
    governed by the terms of this Agreement, specifically additions to the
    Original Code which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
    conjunction with the Original Code under their own license agreement,
    and (ii) are not derivative works of the Original Code.
2.Grant of Rights
  a)Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
    perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
    if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
    The limited license granted in this Section is only for the integration
    of the Contribution with or for the use of the Contribution in
    connection with other proprietary software of OPERA, including but not
    limited to OPERA’s browser software.
  b)Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
    provided by any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
    secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
  c)Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
    license set forth in this Agreement.
  d)Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, no other rights or
    licenses, express or implied, are granted by OPERA herein, including but
    not limited to any rights to trademarks, service marks or logos
    belonging to OPERA, OPERA’s suppliers or to any Contributor.

          merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
        2.effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
          damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
          consequential damages, such as lost profits;
      3.states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
      4.states that the Contribution only may be integrated with or used with

      Agreement must be included with each copy of the Covered Code.
    2.Each Contributor must duplicate, to the extent it does not already
      exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Covered Code of all
      Contributions, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that the contributor changed the files and the date of any
      change.
    3.In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator
      of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
      subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4.No Warranty
  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE COVERED CODE IS
  PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
  WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible
  for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
  Covered Code for commercial and non-commercial purposes and assumes all
  risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
  including but not limited to the risks and costs of Covered Code errors,
  compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, code or
  equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
5.Disclaimer of Liability
  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
  ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
  INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
  WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
  LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
  DISTRIBUTION OF THE COVERED CODE OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
  HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
6. General
  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
  the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
  by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
  extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
  to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
  and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
  becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
  this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
  of the Covered Code as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
  Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
  Recipient relating to the Covered Code shall continue and survive.

  OPERA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
  from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
  distinguishing version number. The Covered Code (including
  Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
  Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
  of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
  Covered Code (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one
  other than OPERA has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as
  expressly stated in Section 2(a), Recipient receives no rights or
  licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
  Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All
  rights in the Covered Code not expressly granted under this Agreement
  are reserved.

  This Agreement is governed by the laws of Norway. Any and all disputes
  arising out of the rights and obligations in this Agreement shall be
  submitted to ordinary court proceedings. You accept the Oslo City Court
  as legal venue under this Agreement.</pre><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>&larr;[AppliesTo] Proprietary Free</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(1563)"></div><p>Proprietary Free</p><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div></div></div><h2>forward</h2><div class="tree"><h3>owal-1.0</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(7378)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div><div class="tree"><h3>Opera Web Applications License v1.0 [Same]&rarr;</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(7377)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>Opera Web Applications License 1.0 [Same]&rarr;</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(7376)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="tree"><h3>LicenseRef-scancode-owal-1.0 [Same]&rarr;</h3><div class="anchor" id="NodeIndex(7375)"></div><h5>Origins:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/">Scancode licensedb</a></li></ul><div></div></div></div></div><h2>dot</h2><pre>digraph {
